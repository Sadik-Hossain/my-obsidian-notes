#### The new model of selling

NEPQ
- **85% Engagement Stage**
	- trust
	- letting their guard down
	- results-based thinking
	- problem finding
	- building a gap
	- objection prevention
	- future pacing
- **10% presentation solution**
- **5% commitment/closing**

**People buy from people/company that they trust.**

point to be noted, Liking you is just secondary to trusting you that you can get them the best result.


#### The first part of NEPQ is consequence question

**NEPQ -- Connecting Q's**
- Take focus off you, puts it on your prospect
- gets them into **results based thinking** over price/cost based thinking
- helps disarm the prospect-- let their guard down

**Strategy**
- much better Q's to set them to internalize
- How can we use tonality to cause prospects to want them to open up emotionally
- How do we build a gap
- How do we help them find a problem they didn't know they have.
	If u can help them find their problems, they will view you as an expert, somebody they can trust
