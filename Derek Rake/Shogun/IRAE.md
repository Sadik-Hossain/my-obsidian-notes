> *The process of seduction is essentially a transfer of emotion, and that emotion is Desirability*


<hr>

##### Action Limit
---
It's the level of Desirability that you’ve got to be at for her to say “yes” to your request (e.g: number, sleep, meet).

Every woman has got different Action Limits which depends on how “committal” your requests are.

>*Different commitment levels correspond to different Action Limits*

For example, 
you may not have to be as exceedingly desirable as, say, Brad Pitt for a woman to give you her phone number. 
On the other hand, a hot supermodel may have impossibly high Action Limits that merely getting her email address deserves a victory lap around Arc De Triomphe.

##### Pain Limit
---
It refers to the distress or discomfort that a woman feels related to her interaction with you. 
Note that this is not a negative thing: in fact, you can easily seduce her if you are seen to hold the key to relieving her of pain and agony.

>*Humans are motivated more by pain than by pleasure*

you can seduce by ***inducing emotional discomfort*** inside a woman.

Action and Pain Limits have strong influence on each other

For example, if a woman reaches her Pain Limit, her Action Limit is lowered temporarily.

For example,
if a woman is getting dumped (i.e. she reaches the threshold of her Pain Limit), then she might be more open to being seduced by any guy that she could find (i.e. her Action Limit is temporarily lowered).


##### IRAE Model
---
>No matter where you start on the Desirability Scale, you want to get to 10. 
>And the fastest way to do this is to follow the IRAE model.

It consists of four distinct stages: 
Stage 1: Generate Intrigue 
Stage 2: Develop Rapport
Stage 3: Build Attraction
Stage 4: Create Enslavement

these stages or steps must be taken ***sequentially***.

- Intrigue generation is always the first step, It serves for you to capture her attention and interest for you to build rapport with her (second stage). 

- And once the foundational amount of rapport with her is achieved, then start to attract her to you (third stage).

- Finally, by continually intensifying attraction you get her enslaved to you emotionally.


<center><b><u>Everything is done strictly in that order</u></b></center>
Skipping any of the steps in the sequence will usually result in failure. For example:

1. **Trying to build rapport without intrigue:** the woman loses interest in talking to you, looks over your shoulder, finds an excuse to leave, etc. 
2. **Trying to build attraction without rapport:** the woman finds you creepy, feeling uncomfortable around you 
3. **Staying too long in the rapport stage:** you get “friend-zoned” 
4. **Trying to enslave her without attraction:** this is the stuff that psychopaths are made of!


<center><u><b>Stage 1: Generate Intrigue</b></u></center>

The goal in the Intrigue phase is simple - to **capture and hold the target’s attention.**

<center><u><b>Stage 2: Develop Rapport</b></u></center>

After the Intrigue stage,
you will have sufficient face time to build and deepen rapport with your target before you start attracting her. 
Building rapport can take minutes or stretch up to days or weeks - it all depends on what you want (remember that different commitment levels correspond to different Action Limits).

<u>Note:</u>
too much time in the Rapport stage is that you get stuck inside the dreaded “friend zone”.

<center><u><b>Stage 3: Build Attraction</b></u></center>

after developing enough rapport with the target, you can start to attract her. 
this is where heavy duty Mind Control techniques are used to “bridge” from passing interest to deep attraction. 
never attempt to build attraction without sufficient rapport.


<center><u><b>Stage 4: Create Enslavement</b></u></center>

this step is entirely optional.
You will have the ability to control a woman’s mind and manipulate her emotions for as long as you wish - even for a lifetime if you so desire.
if you want to subjugate her and turn her into your emotional slave, possibly for a lifetime (the effect is impossible to undo). The choice is entirely yours.
