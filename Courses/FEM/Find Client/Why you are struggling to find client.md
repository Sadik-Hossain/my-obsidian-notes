Most agencies or freelancers are solely reliant on word-of-mouth recommendations.\
This section addresses why this is a problem & why many of the alternatives aren't much better.

#### What you really want from your marketing?
- More leads 
- Better clients (if you don't want to working for same client of low end market).
- Easier\
	vast amount of time & energy for winning work (pitching) is huge. Sometime, cant even win a work even after a lot of back of forth pitching which is such a waste.\
	we don't have the time for doing non-chargeable work (eg: blogging, social media marketing etc. ) every time you're not working on chargeable work you're losing money.\
	so, we have to come up with a way to minimize the effort and maximizing results. From winning people's attention to all the way through getting work.

#### 4 common mistakes made by agencies & freelancers

##### relying too heavily on word of mouth

**It is passive**\
word of mouth relies on clients recommending you. There is nothing you can do but ask clients for recommendations. Therefore, you cannot proactively generate business.\
In other words, its out of your control, this isn't your input goal.

**It is limiting**\
Word of mouth typically happens within sectors & companies of a similar size. That means its not a good way to break into new sectors or gain bigger clients.

**It is risky**\
Word of mouth is common within different groups of a large organization. However, that means you can quickly rely on one or two large clients whose departure would be devastating.

##### wasting money of online advertising & getting work through online marketplaces

Online ads & marketplaces like upwork tend to attract smaller businesses who primarily choose based on price.

Even procurement platforms with larger projects are rarely worth your time. Often they already have a preferred supplier & post because they are required to.

Bottom line,\
There is no relationship. You are just another supplier(commodity).

**We want clients to approach us, because they want to work specifically with us.**


##### Approaching content marketing in the wrong way

Content marketing can work. But you are doing it wrong.

Content marketing is great for establishing your credibility & for increasing your reach. But, it has its challenges.

**Challenges**
- **Too much noise**\
	because, content marketing works, everybody's doing it. Its hard to get people's attention with so much noise online.
- **Gone and forgotten**\
	Even if somebody see your content, it will quickly move on and be unlikely to remember you when they are looking for services you supply.
- **Lacking time**\
	producing content is incredibly time-consuming. Time that you could be spending doing client work.

####  Email offers the answer


**B2B Lives in email**\
social media and blogs are fine, but our prospective clients live in email, email is the primary means of communication for almost all businesses.

**You will be seen**\
people may not read every email they receive, but they will see it. That cannot be said for other channels, seeing your name is enough to remind them to exist.

**You will be read**\
I have over 8500 subscribers currently and a 38% open rate. That means every weeks 3230 potential clients read about my expertise.

**The good reasons of email**\
you own your email list, its not some social media platform where they can change the algorithm and wipe you off the face of the earth in a blink of an eye.\


> [!quote] So, this leaves us with needing to get people on a mailing list, so that we can build a relationship.

#### Get people to sub with a sales funnel


**What is a sales funnel**\
its a journey where from the moment someone first hears about that you exist to the moment they sign up to your service.

In many ways, it reflects a customer journey map, but with more emphasis on how you move the customer towards hiring you.


**Our simplistic funnel**
- attract attention
- build a connection
- keep engaging (keep them hearing us regularly)
- encouraging contact 
- close a deal


> [!warning] Disclaimer: This is not a quick fix 
> when clients first enter your sales funnel, they may not intended to buy your services. It, therefore, may take years to get them to that point of purchase.


#### Why you want a sales funnel

**Targeted**\
we can pick a group of particular clients you want to work with and you can focus on those.\
I wanna work for those people, lets build a sales funnel for them.

**Consistent**\
Once our sales funnel has been up and running for a while, it will provide a relatively consistent and reliable source of new clients.

**Controllable**\
By tweaking your sales funnel and the messaging, you can control the type of client and work you want to do.

#### 1. Attract attention

first thing first we have to grab peoples attention.

we will identify and make contact with our audience, however we will not sell, as they are not ready to buy it.

Instead, we will approach them for research purposes, this is a non-threatening way to get on their radar. we gonna ask for their help, feedback for some research that we are carrying out.

later on, we are gonna give them something value.\
we will introduce a course or report we are creating and ask for their feedback on it. This establishes credibility.

we are gonna involve them on the creational process. 

what we're doin is basically building awareness of our lead magnet through guest blogging, speaking, social media and more.\

we are gonna make them aware that we exist by,
- our interest in our sector
- our desire to help them & provide them value
later on we can further build awareness through guest blogging, speaking, social media and more.

#### 2. Build a connection 

we build connection by offering them something free. In return for, get into contact them & build a relationship.

when the report or course is complete, we will approach them again 
making it available for free. 

When they access the course, we will ask them to sign up for a mailing list offering advice and best practice. (not selling but sharing more advice)

**==by giving away, by helping people, you get the permission to need to stay in contact with them for a longer period of time==**


#### 3. Keep them engaged

Once on the mailing list, we will keep them engaged by providing regular and valuable content.

The goal of keeping them engaged is that they remember you, when they need your services.

### 4. Encourage Contact

we use the mailings to encourage your subscribers to make personal contact with you and reach out to you if they need advice and support.

The reason behind someone hires you over someone else is,
they like you, they like the way you think, act, behave.\
you bring professionalism, attitude, personality. \
you bring dopamine to their life.\
All of those thing sell.

And that comes from building trust, relationship, communication.

And ask them to email if you got any questions, doubts, clarification of your content, if you wanna know more.

#### Sales funnel Recap

- grab your prospect attention
- gain their permission to contact them regularly
- demonstrate value & expertise to show our worth for working with them
- keep in contact until they are ready to purchase.
