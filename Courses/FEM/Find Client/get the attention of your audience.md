Once you have chosen your audience, you need to get their attention.\
This section will show you how to maximize the limited time you have to do just that.

## How to Plan an effective attention strategy

**we will not be selling**\
people can smell spam a mile away. The minute it becomes anything other than, an honest sincere interests on,
- who they are
- what they do
- how their job works
- challenges that they faces on a daily basis.
and turns into a sales thing, forget it, it blows off.

Also, even if you did write them a sales email, the chance of contacting them at the exact moment whether they're willing to buy are pretty unlikely.

**However, we will...**
- Ask for their help.\
	spam wants you to buy something or do something, spam does not seek your opinion or want to hear from you.\
	Instead, we will ask people to share their experiences & wisdom. That makes **people feel valued and listened to.**
- Provide value in return\
	in return for them sharing their experiences, we are going to provide them with insights into their sectors & job, a lightweight review of their websites & ongoing advice and support.


## The Deliverables

What are we going to sending/providing them.


**A report**\
In return for signing up for our emails, we will provide an industry report that gives them insights into how their sector is using digital. Challenges it face, some advice & best practice on that.

**A short site review**\
we will also offer a short first impression (ui/ux, accessibility, analytics, web perf, stuff that can be seen from frontend) in return for their participation, in providing information that will go into the report.

we will say them the following,
```
thank you so much for giving us a lil bit of your time to share your experience with us. 
In return for that, if you want us to do, quick first impression review for your website. In return for your participation, then we would happily do that, as a thank you.
```
we are giving value.

**Regular emails**\
we will provide ongoing value & keep people engaged by sending them regular advice via email that helps them overcome the challenges they face in their role.

## How we will engage with our audience

**Introduction**\
Although, we wont expect a reply, we will introduce ourselves and explain we are researching the sector. Then, we will ask them what they would like to know about their sector and its use of digital.

we wanna help overcome some of the challenges or get to know about challenges.

we are gonna ask them, whether they would find our report(free value) useful? whether there are challenges that we can help with.


> [!info] Dont expect to get a reply
> The aim is not to get replied, rather the aim is, `hey, we are here! we are working on this.`
> 
> ---
> `hey, we are gonna do something, in this area. we wanna help people in this area, help addressing the challenges and overcoming those, you've got any ideas/advice/opinion/suggestion/shareable experience.`

**Follow up with Survey**\
Later we will follow up with a survey, that we will inform our report. we will offer them the report for free, as well as a site review if they complete the survey.

in the survey, we can say things like, `we wanna understand the sector a lil bit, so we put together a survey`

**Final Reachout -- Report**\
Finally,  we will let them know when the report is available. They can download the survey from a landing page where they will also signup for an email series covering the report in more detail.


## What should your report focus on?

>[!info] The aim of the report is to give them something of value, in return for their interaction.
> in return for, acknowledging that we exist & engaging with you.

A report is a good way of doing that. This is working like a ***lead magnet.***


**What to include in the report**\
- ***Where does your expertise lies?***\
	for ex: \
	if you're specializing on performance, than you're report is always going to talk about performance related issue.\
	if data scientist you will talk about data, visualization.
	if ux/ui engr, talk about design / visual / accessibility issue.
- ***what kind of work do you want to win?***\
	it should also focus on, the kind of work that you want to win more of.\
	if you're working on ux design, and you're frustrated to not get enough testing, your report might be, `how testing might help, higher edu sector.`\
	so you're tying it back to your product/service/offer.
- ***What problems do you want to draw attention to?***\
	drawing attention to different problem & challenges within the sector. or offering solution to a sector.\
	if you're on a search, you discover problem is that there is no time & budget to enable proper usability testing on a website, you're report can focus on how to get that/make that happen/bring change.

For ex:\
Im a ux consultant, and I enjoy conversion optimization work & yet am frustrated that most organizations launch their websites and abandon them.

My report, therefore, might focus on the fact that a website needs to post launch optimization.

The report is doing various things:
- giving us a reason to reach out to people
- its offering an incentive to signup to our mailing list.
- its demonstrating our expertise.
- focusing on issues relevant to them, that we can help them with.

**Does it need to be a report?**\
No, it could equally be an app, tool, code library, wordpress template as long as its free.

The only advantage a report provides is that it contains written content that *can be reused* and built upon.


> [!caution] before we create a report/tool, we are gonna reach out and find out 
> - what the report should be about
> - what kind of tool it would be used for.

we do that by contacting the people in the list of companies & the list of influencers/blogs/forums.

The upfront work like creating the report, email sequences, lead gen can be time consuming at first, but do this in slow year and you only have to do it once / twice a year.

## Making Initial Contact


> [!tip] Do everything you can to prevent it looking like a marketing email
> Keep it plain, simple & avoid any links.

**Email**

TO: `prospect@role.company`

FROM: `mypersonal@email.com`

> [!info] send it from personal email address, avoid corporate one.

SUB: `Can I ask for your advice?`

> [!info] the sub makes it clear that its not selling something & not like a typical spam email.

BODY:
```
Hello lucy,

(acknowledge the email is unsolicited, make ppl feel appreciated by suggesting they were recommended, if possible naming a mutual contact really helps)
---
Sorry for emailing out of the blue, but it was suggested that you might be an ideal person to contact.
---

(keep intro short, and relevant to audience)
---
My name is Paul & I run a user experience consultancy called XYZ, who specialize in charity fundraising.
or,
My name is Paul, Im doing some research into charity fundraising.
---

(flatter them by calling them an expert and imply they will be associated with other experts. Finally, make it clear why you are emailing)
---
The reason I'm writing is that, alongside experts in the field such as yourself, I'm preparing a report on the state of digital fundraising.
---

(make it clear why you are asking for their advice)
---
however, before I undertake formal research, I want ensure that the scope of this report is relevant and provide maximum value.
---

(Highlight what you are specifically asking then, give them some examples to provide them with something to respond to)
--[this part is bolden]--
I would appreciate any insights you may have into what areas of research would prove particularly useful. For ex: I was considering focusing on the level of user research & testing being done in the sector. Would this be relevant? Are there other areas I should be looking at?
---

(show you value their time & only ask for one or two lines response)
---
I appreciate that you are busy & dont know me. However, even a line or two pointing me in relevant directions would be hugely beneficial.

Thanks for your time

Thanks,
Paul

its lowkey, you're not selling, you're not pushing, **you're just looking to learn from them.**


> [!warning] You may not get any reply
> at this stage its not about replies, its about introducing yourself. However, if you do get replies, make sure you respond by thanking people.\
> **Reference their comments** so they know its not an automated thank you.


## Refining your reports scope

if you receive feedback, make sure you use that to shape the focus of your report.

keep the report as focused as possible but still broad enough for you to be able to write at least 2500 words. It has to feel like more than a blog post.

Try to pick a topic that you will be able to support with numbers. For ex, 22% of respondents have never done usability testing on their websites.
