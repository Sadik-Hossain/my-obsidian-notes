> *objects are collection of key-value pair*

>[!tip] we can use object to group related variable & func.

## object-literal 

using curly braces.

```js 

let circle = { // object literal syntax
radius: 1,
location: {
	x:1,
	y:2,
	}
draw: function(){}
move: function(){}
}

circle.draw(); // method

```

> *if a function is a part of an object, we call that func. a method*


## factory fn.

just like a factory produces product, factory fn. produces object.

```js
// what if we need another circle obj, we dont wanna redo everything again, we use factory fn for that

function createCircle(rad,x,y){

return { // object literal syntax
radius: rad,
location: {
		x:x,
		y:y,
	}
	
	// draw: function(){} 
	draw(){}

 }

}

const circle1 = createCircle(1,2,4)
const circle2 = createCircle(11,12,14)

// as we create more circle, there's only one place to modify our draw method, what a timesaver!
```

## constructor fn.

 the job of a constructor fn. is to create a function.\
but there's a naming convention, pascal notation

```js

function Circle(rad){

this.rad = rad;
this.draw = function(){}

// in js, the this keyword is a reference to the object that is executing this piece of code.

// for now, lets imagine this refers to an empty object {}

// as obj is dynamic in js, we can set additional properties, even after its initialization

}

// when we use new operator 3 things happens:
// - it creates an empty js obj , ex: const x = {}

// - it will set `this` to point the new empty obj

// - finally, it will return this new populated object from the Circle func., for this reason we dont explictly write the return statement
 
const circle = new Circle(1);

```


## Dynamic Nature of Object

in JS objects are dynamic, which means,\
when you create them, you can always add new properties or methods, or remove existing ones.

```js

const circle = {
radius: 1;
}

//adding new prop & method
circle.color = "yellow";
circle.draw = function(){}

delete circle.color;
delete circle.draw;


```

>[!danger] one thing about `const`
> `const` means we cannot `re-asssign`, but we can always change/modify. Like adding or removing properties.
> 
> ```js
> const circle = {} 
> circle = {} // reassigning
> // we get typeError: cannot assign to const variable  
>  
>  ```

## Constructor property

Every object in js, has a property called `constructor`. And that ***references the function that was used to construct or create that object***.

```js
