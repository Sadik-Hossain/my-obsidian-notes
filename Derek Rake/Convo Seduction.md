##### what exactly do women want?
---
the truth is that women desire something far simpler (not to mention less expensive).
- They want to be cherished. 
- They long to be the apple of your eye…adored and savored. 
Make a woman feel like this, and she’ll never stray.

if a guy does know how to speak to and treat women, he probably doesn’t know how to read their body language. Women are a mystery, and their expressions or behaviors serve to clue men into this mystery.

Lets say, you find someone attractive, you cant take your eyes off her. she catches you checking her out.

You quickly look away, as though you’ve done something wrong by checking her out.

This one movement is enough to ruin any interest she might have had in you, as **it plainly shows your insecurities.** The worst part is that you know this.


> **The truth is that a lot of girls enjoy being checked out.** 
> ***It all boils down to their feminine desire to be cherished, beautiful, and savored.***


If, on the other hand, she appears disinterested in your interest, what’s the big deal? You’ve got nothing to be ashamed of, and no harm was done.

**Stop feeling ashamed.**

==there’s nothing wrong== with looking, so stop being embarrassed. 
embrace this truth to overcome your insecurities.
When that happens, you’ll be more confident at approaching the opposite sex.

###### Making Eye Contact
---
<u>how do you effectively look at a woman?</u>

For starters, don’t quickly look away, as though you’ve done something wrong by checking her out.
**You’ve demonstrated with your eyes that you find her attractive**, and aren’t the eyes the windows to the soul?
Rather than look away, why not accompany your eyes with a sincere smile?

women need to feel beautiful.
 
**Almost every woman (no matter how stunning) possesses insecurity.**

>***women are constantly in a state of self improvement.
>Fixing something that wasn’t broken in the first place.
>Everything from the clothes they buy to the surgical procedures they put themselves through is proof of this.***

don’t think that you’re insulting them by admiring their beauty. Instead, you’re doing them a favor. 
You’re acknowledging their natural splendor & that's a rare gesture that never goes unappreciated.

You make eye contact with her, and instead of looking away, you smile. A few minutes later, you catch her watching you again. 

What should you make of this information?

she’s appreciating your admiration of her.
She’s also indicating to you a mutual interest on her part (remember what I said about a woman’s body language?) 
Consider this a good sign, as it’s the green light for you to get to know her.

###### A few things to consider
---
never stare for too long at a woman. 
10sec is a sweet spot. Anything more than that will scare her away.

After you make eye contact, look away and focus on your drink, friends, etc. This eliminates any creepiness she might feel.
It will show her you have your own agenda, after a few min or so, check her out again.
rinse & repeat.

###### A Smile
---
Use a smile.
If she seems to be the conservative type, then go light on the bedroom eyes. 
If, she seems outgoing and ready to mingle, maybe throw in a wink or funny face.
It’s all about judgment, so just follow your instincts.
If she returns the smile, it’s time to start talking.

**simple eye contact and smiling can convey interest.**

take a moment to correct walk, posture, and other signals of body language. Every step in her direction can work for or against you, so pay attention to the message you’re sending.
