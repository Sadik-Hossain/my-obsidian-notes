Making money as a copywriter is not about being the perfect copywriter. Making money as a copywriter, is about being able to sell yourself.

topics to be covered:
- consistently close bigger deals using a two part sales script.
- being too empathetic is hurting your answers of closing the deal and why your clients actually feel disrespected when you're empathetic towards them.
- discover the real reason you hate selling and how  to banish those emotions from your life for good.
- look at whether or not you should close on the first call
- three small talk tips, So you never experience awkward moments in your zoom calls again.
- how to make big promises without having it come back to bite us in the butt. so that you can go in, tell your client, Hey! we're going to achieve these really great results. And even if you fail, they will not ask for a refund.

## The Salesman mindset
---
Most people hate selling for 3 reasons.
- **don't believe in what they're selling. (lack of confidence)**\
	 The only thing you can really do is keep trudging forward and work on those tiny projects until you get to a point where you feel like, you're good enough, keep working your way forward. And eventually you'll overcome this.
- **Limited pie, selling to one means taking from another (one person wins, one loses)**\
	Shift from 'win-lose' to 'win-win' by providing value. For Ex: $10k service generates $100k for client (10x return).\
	Focus on the value you create, not just your service cost. Client pays for results, not just deliverables. Educate & help clients understand the value for themselves & how it increase their own opportunities.


> [!tip] What if the investment fails?
> if it fails, its not like they've lost all their money, they don't see the bigger picture as a business owner and as a person who's hiring.\
> if the owner investing on 10 people and one of them brings result times 40, the owner is making so much money.


> [!tip] This mindset is often something that you're gonna have to teach the client as well.
> The notion in that, they are paying for a thing, so that you can make them more money.\
> and not just, they're paying you for a website because they need to make sure that they have a website.

- **Hitting roadblocks**\
	if you've ever tried to accomplish anything in life, you know that this is a fact.\
	you start something and you suck, and then you can either choose to systematically improve, or you can choose to give up, Those are really the only two options.\
	Because, if you keep going the way, you're going without the systematic improvement, then you're going to continue to experience failure.
	
	so, to tackle that, you have to document your moves and failures and study them, and approach things differently. You can spreadsheet the messages you've sent, the date, the first call, second call, the sales, the revenue you generated etc. You can do this day to day, week to week.\
	for ex: \
	msg sent: 100\
	first call: 60\
	second call: 30\
	closed deal/sales: 10\
	rev generated: $xyz\
	as you keep doing it over and over, you see the improvement. Its all gamification.


## Upwork Inbound: The easy sale
---
**What is an inbound sale?**\
An inbound sale is like,\
when someone's coming to you and saying, *"hey! I kind of want what you're trying to selling me. Can you just sell me on it?"*

where an outbound sale is where the you cold call a bunch of people, and try to persuade them to buy something.


> [!tip] an inbound sale is easy! Because,  the prospect is coming to you and asking you to sell them.


## The 3-step inbound sales process
---
- **1. Tell me what you want**\
	- Tell me what you had in mind for... (whatever you're trying to achieve)
	- And how were you thinking of using...(whatever we offering as solution)
	- Can I share a few thoughts based on my previous experience with...(whatever you're trying to achieve)
	Basically, these questions are helping us to proper diagnose the prospects problems and needs and results they are looking for.
- **2. I'll tell you why it sucks** \
	- so just to make sure I understood, you're trying to... ,right?
	- Perfect! Now in my experience, when it comes to... you absolutely can do... but have you considered the risk/success percentage associated with it..., does that make sense?
- **3. Here's what to do instead**\
	Awesome, so what Im thinking is ... and if we can ... then we'll easily be able to achieve... - what do you think?

The prospect wants someone that can add onto their business that can expand their business and that can bring in new sources of revenue or better results.\
And if someone does that, of course, they wanna work With you. 
 
I took what he said. And I say, yes! you're right.
 
here is the difference between what you're asking and what I'm talking about doing. Does this sound like something you want? whether or not that's valuable to you? Yes or no.
 
And so acknowledge and validate what he just said to me,\
==present the opposition & then ask them whether or not that's valuable to them.==\
That's *how* you can handle every single objection.


> [!tip] Cold Outreach
> if somebody did reach out and in like four words they can highlight that, they have already solved a problem that the prospect currently have, that the prospect either was not aware of or that now aware of.\
> thanks to them! They would be pressed enough to keep paying attention.

For example, When you ask these questions,\
"Hey, I was actually just about to buy this, or I was checking out and then I forgot to buy it, and I just realized you never hit me with an abandoned cart. Do you not have an abandoned cart sequence?"

Like ==when you start asking, you're bringing value because, you've made them aware of a problem, they didn't know they had.== So you know what that one right there specifically, abandoned cart, just to get real specific for half a second here, specifically abandoned cart, that's something you can identify for free.

You can figure out if they have an abandoned cart or not or any problem they might have just by going through their product/ service and find lacking/areas they can improve. Put yourself in a customer's shoe.

for ex:\
you can start the checkout process or you can go to the checkout page, and if you don't get an email somewhere saying, "Hey, did you want to buy this?" That's something right up front.\


You could potentially even write that email sequence for free and say, ==*"Hey, I noticed you don't have an abandoned cart sequence in place. I wanted to go ahead and just see if I could help you right up front, add value in advance. Here's an abandoned cart sequence for this offer for you."*==

And you can further follow along with,
*=="Hey, listen, I know this will add dollars to your sales every single month if you add this in place. And what I'd like to do is to figure out more ways I can add dollars into your business every single month. Would you be open to a conversation?"==*


### Why Call no.2
---
The two-call close is a sales strategy that gives salespeople time to prepare presentations. It'll give you time to present a proper presentation.\
build rapport with potential customers. Because, it allows you to also do a little bit of relationship-building between call number one and call number two.\
It avoids pressuring customers into immediate decisions, it doesn't force the prospect to make a decision right then and there. Thus, can lead to higher closing rates.

schedule second call for two days out, then after our first call, send an email saying, "Hey Luke! it was great talking to you. I'm gonna put some thought into this, really looking forward to our next call." And that might be all that it is, but it shows Luke that I'm a normal, decent human being.

### Setup the second call
---
"Awesome, well I'd love to take a day or two to really think about this, draft a few ideas, and then we can get together and I'll be able to tell you what the cost would be for each of the options. Are you free...?"

So here, in this sentence, we are doing a few things.\
- One, we are saying, "Yes, you definitely do need more information before you make a decision." This is good because we are validating him.
- Then saying, "I am going to draft a few ideas." So you are not just getting the template solution that I use for everyone else.\
	I am going to come up with something specific for you.\
	This will matter to you and will help you achieve your business goals.\
	We can get together, and I will be able to tell you what the cost would be for each of these options. we're gonna get a few different tiers ready. and we're gonna select what's best for your goals plus your budget.
- Are you free? give them two options for dates and times based on your availabilities.\
	for ex: would it be better for you if we did 10th july 8am or the 11th at 2:00 PM, rather than just saying, okay, perfect.\
	psychologically, we're forcing him to make the choice out of two options. Because, they gonna get distracted. He's not gonna book the next call. We're not gonna make the sale.\
	I'm saying, Luke, tangibly right now, look at your calendar. Tell me which of these two days work best for you. You  have two options, pick one.

### On the second call
---
- zoom, small talk, screen share, funnel analytic, presentation
- always get agreement on one plan, then present price
- step-by-step "assumptive" close
	its basically, get all of your prospects information and send an invoice and confirm payment.

## Outreach Inbound: where the real money is made
---
 you're reaching out to people and then they're coming in and saying,  yes, I'm interested!\
direct outreach, we can think of it as  LinkedIn, cold email, Facebook groups, Instagram any social media or email that you're doing that is outreach reach inbound.

So when you're connecting with people through outreach, reframing what you say before the call is very,  very important. You do not want to give any information relating to your offer.\
The thing is when you're texting, there's too much nuance for you to properly convey your value and the client or the prospect, won't be able to understand what you're providing.

If the prospect says, \
Can you tell me a little bit more about what you do or what you would do for me then?\
You don't say yes. Here's all the information. Instead say,\
yes, I would love that. That's in fantastic idea. can we hop on a call together? is this time better?\
So that's how you transition from your outreach. You try to get them onto a call.

### On the call
---
**The 7 Steps**
- **small talk**
- **the perfect pre-frame (diagnosis)**\
	the way that we want to do it, is just like we were doing in the upward inbound.\
	We're going to get all of the information, that we need to discover prospect's motivations & why they wants to move towards the result that we are promising that we can get them.
- **validate & qualify**\
	 You always want to find reasons to compliment your prospect. You never want to tell them that they suck before you get to this point. And even when you tell 'em they suck, you're still complimenting them.\ 
	 It's all a game of making Luke feel like I'm a normal, good, awesome human being. I'm not just some forceful marketing  idiot. Who's trying to control his business. So, I'm gonna validate him.
- **permission to pitch**\
- **pitch**\
- **make sure they understand**\
- **move to second call**\

 So we're doing the same kind of thing as what we're doing in the Upwork Inbound.\
 ==This one, we're just looking at a few more steps. because, they're coming in without having asked you for anything. You just need to do a little bit more warming up.==


on the call, 
you start it with a false time constraint and then permission to ask questions.\
False time constraint is like,\
Hey, I only have X amount of time and then I've got to go.\
So it puts a little bit of urgency and it also says, I'm not a weirdo, Who's gonna take about three hours for this presentation.

So Luke and I just went through the small talk and then I say,\
so Luke, I'm just looking at the time. And I see we've only got about 45 minutes scheduled for this call.\
So, is it cool if I just ask you some questions? to make sure that I understand everything. that way, I'm able to get a better idea of your business and then what the steps should be, moving forward together. And then we move into motivation.

for ex:
luke wants a landing page for his business.\
then we ask,\
why do you want landing page for your business? / what results are you trying to achieve with landing page? / do actually need a landing page? 

luke says,\
they are launching a product, and they want to feed new customer, so that they can sell the product.

Now you wanna validate, and I want a future pace.\
So validation is saying, yes, that's a great idea.\
And then future pacing is, let's look at the results of this X amount of time from now.

So you reply to luke by saying,\
that sounds fantastic! I love that you are already familiar with terms like front end and back end. It shows me that you are a sophisticated  marketer and you guys have some really good stuff going for you already.\

I would like to ask, once you get this set up, in terms of just plan for the future.\
looking at your growth, lets just say through to the end of 2022.\
What kind of results do you hope to see quarter by quarter, month by  month, maybe you've broken it down week by week. Just gimme a high level overview of what you guys are thinking of accomplishing.

so now, you've gone through the why's and now the next step is what they have tried so far?

and you can get the idea, of all of the stuff they failed and succeeded achieving, so when you get to your pitch you can say this is not like the stuff that failed, this is like the stuff where you've seen success.

and then you ask, what do you think you are missing?

and thru this diagnosis you've discovered everything from what
he wants, how he thinks he's going to get there and what he likes, what he doesn't like out of what he's tried so far.

during every sales call,\
You wanna be taking notes of the specific words that he's using to describe his motivations, the things that he's tried that have worked and have not worked.\
the ideas that he's presenting, anything that you can use to give yourself ammunition, when it comes to presenting your ideas.
 
 then you're going to qualify.\
 So qualify here is depending on the service that you offer, any other questions that you need to clear up, in order to decide ==whether or not you're a good fit for Luke's business?==


So in my case, let's say one of my offers at one point was the six-figure virtual event. So for the six-figure virtual event, I need to know things like existing audience, list size, and how much marketing they're running already. There's a lot of stuff that I need to get into to know whether or not my six-figure virtual event can help them make their business dreams come true.

So this is where I would do that. Any other qualifying questions, but here, we're just talking about a simple landing page, so I don't need to get into it. Just yes, Luke, this would move into step number four, which is permission to pitch before you move into your sale. Ask the person you're selling to whether or not you can sell them. Easy as that.

Because then Luke says, "Yes, I give you permission to sell me," and there's going to be no resistance whatsoever. So I would say something along the lines of, "Great. So based on whatever you just said, I think I've got the perfect thing for you. Do you mind if I share what I'm thinking?" So Luke, based on everything that you just told me about the way that your business is operating right now, I think I have the perfect thing for you. Do you mind if I share what I'm thinking? "Go ahead. I'm curious." Perfect. Awesome.

So he just gave me permission now to sell to him. And this is step number five, where I move into my pitch. This is not the full pitch like you would do on the second sales call. This is just an ideas pitch. So this is where you say, "Based on everything you told me, this is the direction that we should move in. Here's why I believe this is the right direction. Here's what you can expect if we choose to move together in this direction." So that's my pitch. That's really it. And then we go into step number...



try to get prospect to admit that they needs to deliver some kind of persuasion, some kind of value, some kind of desire, before they're able to sell to their customer.\
And so the path was leading them down to that way of why.\
you need to know, or your customer need to know a little bit of about you before they come and spend money at you.
