> *objects are collection of key-value pair*

>[!tip] we can use object to group related variable & func.

## object-literal 

using curly braces.

```js 

let circle = { // object literal syntax
radius: 1,
location: {
	x:1,
	y:2,
	}
draw: function(){}
move: function(){}
}

circle.draw(); // method

```

> *if a function is a part of an object, we call that func. a method*


## factory fn.

just like a factory produces product, factory fn. produces object.

```js
// what if we need another circle obj, we dont wanna redo everything again, we use factory fn for that

function createCircle(rad,x,y){

return { // object literal syntax
radius: rad,
location: {
		x:x,
		y:y,
	}
	
	// draw: function(){} 
	draw(){}

 }

}

const circle1 = createCircle(1,2,4)
const circle2 = createCircle(11,12,14)

// as we create more circle, there's only one place to modify our draw method, what a timesaver!
```

## constructor fn.

 the job of a constructor fn. is to create a function.\
but there's a naming convention, pascal notation

```js

function Circle(rad){

this.rad = rad;
this.draw = function(){}

// in js, the this keyword is a reference to the object that is executing this piece of code.

// for now, lets imagine this refers to an empty object {}

// as obj is dynamic in js, we can set additional properties, even after its initialization

}

// when we use new operator 3 things happens:
// - it creates an empty js obj , ex: const x = {}

// - it will set `this` to point the new empty obj

// - finally, it will return this new populated object from the Circle func., for this reason we dont explictly write the return statement
 
const circle = new Circle(1);

```


## Dynamic Nature of Object

in JS objects are dynamic, which means,\
when you create them, you can always add new properties or methods, or remove existing ones.

```js

const circle = {
radius: 1;
}

//adding new prop & method
circle.color = "yellow";
circle.draw = function(){}

delete circle.color;
delete circle.draw;


```

>[!danger] one thing about `const`
> `const` means we cannot `re-asssign`, but we can always change/modify. Like adding or removing properties.
> 
> ```js
> const circle = {} 
> circle = {} // reassigning
> // we get typeError: cannot assign to const variable  
>  
>  ```

## Constructor property

Every object in js, has a property called `constructor`. And that ***references the function that was used to construct or create that object***.

```js

//constructor fn
function Circle(rad){
this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}
}

const another = new Circle(1) 

//this returns the circle function that we used to create this object
another.constructor // shows the whole func. with body


//factory fn
function createCircle(r){
return{r, draw:function(){}}
}

const circle1 = createCircle(3) 

circle1.constructor // ƒ Object() { [native code] } we get this

// we can see blue ƒ and the name is uppercase, this is a built in constructor function in js

// as we returned an object from our factory func. using object literal syntax, internally it was created using the Object constructor fn.
```

when you create object using object literal syntax, internally the js engine uses this constructor fn.

when we use object literal syntax, js does this:
```js
let x = {}

// js engine translate that to this;
// let x = new Object();

```

```js
// more built in constructor fn

// constructor  // literals
new String()   // '',"",``
new Boolean() // true, false
new Number() // 1,2,4...
```

**Takeaway**\
>[!info] every object has a constructor property, and that references a function that was used to create this object.

## functions are objects

in vscode, when we use the dot notation after the name of the fn, we get autocomplete modal showing the properties and methods

purple icon are methods, blue icon are properties

```js

function Circle(rad){
this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}
}

Circle.name // returns the name of the fn
Circle.length // returns the number of args of the fn

// every obj has constructor properties and that references the fn that was used to create this object

Circle.constructor // ƒ Function() { [native code] }

// we see that a built-in constructor called Function was used to create this Circle constructor fn


```

>[!info] as we declare Circle constructor function using the `function` keyword syntax, internally js engine will use this function constructor to create this object.


```js

//when we declare function, internally its represented like this.

const circle1 = new Function('rad',`
 this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}`)

const circle = new Circle1(1)
```

### Call method

it is used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).


```js
function Circle(rad){
this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}
}

// with this we can call a fn, it takes a this argument, and the arguments for the Circle constructor func. in this case rad

// we pass an empty obj, and the this inside the constructor function will reference to this empty object that we pass here
Circle.call({},1)

```

if we had multiple arg, we would pass it like this:

```js
  
Circle.call({},1,5,2)
```

```js

Circle.call({},1) 
//is equivalent to 
const c1 = new Circle(1);

// when we used the new operator, it internally create an empty object and pass that as the first argument to the call method.

// and this will reference to the {} empty obj, just like the first arg of the call method
```

>[!warning] If we dont use `new` operator, this will by default refer to the global / window object

```js
const c1 = Circle(1);
//is equivalent to 
Circle.call(window,1);

//so, the first argument, specifies the target of `this`

```


The example below calls `person1.fullName` with `person2` as an argument, `this` refers to `person2`, even if `fullName` is a method of `person1`:

```js
const person1 = {  
  fullName: function() {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
}  
  
const person2 = {  
  firstName:"John",  
  lastName: "Doe",  
}  
  
// Return "John Doe":  
person1.fullName.call(person2);
```
### apply

> ***apply is exactly like call method, but instead of passing all the arguments explicitly we pass them in an array.***

The difference is:
- The `call()` method takes arguments **separately**.
- The `apply()` method takes arguments as an **array**.

```js

Circle.apply({}, [1,2,3])

//this is helpful if we already have an array somewhere defined in our application, this will help us change our array only in one place.
```



### bind

> ***With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.***

 **using bind for function borrowing**

```js
const person = {  
  firstName:"John",  
  lastName: "Doe",  
  fullName: function () {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
}  
  
const member = {  
  firstName:"Hege",  
  lastName: "Nilsen",  
}  

// The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object
let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
```

**Using bind for preserving `this`**

> ***Sometimes the `bind()` method has to be used to prevent losing `this`.***


>[!warning] When a function is used as a callback, `this` is lost.

This example will try to display the person name after 3 seconds, but it will display `undefined` instead:

```js
const person = {  
  firstName:"John",  
  lastName: "Doe",  
  display: function () {  
   console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);  
  }  
}  
  
setTimeout(person.display, 3000); // undefined undefined

//or 
function a(cb) {
    return cb()
}
a(person.display) // undefined undefined
```

The `bind()` method solves this problem.

In the following example, the `bind()` method is used to bind `person.display` to person.

This example will display the person name after 3 seconds:

```js
const person = {  
  firstName:"John",  
  lastName: "Doe",  
  display: function () {  
   console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName); 
  }  
}  

// preserve this by passing the person obj in bind method
let display = person.display.bind(person);  
setTimeout(display, 3000);
```

### What is `this`?

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to an **object**.

The `this` keyword refers to **different objects** depending on how it is used:

| In an object method, `this` refers to the **object**.                              |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.                                     |
| In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**.                             |
| In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.                              |
| In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.             |
| Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to **any object**. |

>[!warning] `this` is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of `this`.



## Value vs Reference Types

In Js, we have 2 categories of types. 
- **value types (primitives)**
	- Number
	- String
	- Boolean
	- Symbol
	- undefined
	- null
- **reference types**
	- Object
	- Function
	- Array

As we learned, in js Function and Arrays are Objects.\
So in a nutshell, we have primitive and objects.

```js
// x & y are two independent variable
let x = 10;
let y = x; // the value that is stored in x, is now copied into this new y variable. And they are independed of eachother

x = 20;


let x = {val: 10};
// the object is not stored in the variable, its stored somewhere in the memory.
// And the address of that memory location is stored inside that variable.

let y = x; // we are copying the address or the reference 

// in other word, both x & y pointing to the same object in memory

// and we modify each object using either x or y, our changes are immediately visible to the other variable.
x.val = 20;

x // {val: 20}
y // {val: 20}
```

>[!tldr] **Conclusion**
***Primitives are copied by their value.***\
***Objects are copied by their reference.***

```js

let num = 10;
function inc(num){
num++
}

inc(num);

console.log(num) //10

// wasnt it supposed to be 11? well, when we pass this number to the function, its value is copied into this parameter, that is local in the this function.

// so the num variable in the function body is completely independent of this other variable. here this function will increment by 1.

// after the function is completed executing, its going to go out of scope 

// so when we log this number in the console, we are essentially dealing the first number declaration.

// Primitives are copied by their value. we are dealing with 2 independent copies of the variable.


```


```js

let num = {val: 10};
function inc(num){
num.val++
}

inc(num);

console.log(num) // {val: 11}

// this num object is passed by its reference, so this local parameter of the function is pointing to the same object that we defined at the start.

// we are not dealing with two independent copies. so any changes we make to this object will be visible to the other variable.

```
