## process of getting client
---
goes to fiverr,\
and goes to a b2b lead generation sellers, and bought the a gold package of 500 leads.

**why buying leads?**\
scraping leads takes longer times, and its a cumbersome process.\
he prefers to pay to who can get leads better & good at scraping at.\
not only your getting high quality leads, but also comes with good bounce rate guarantee.

each row has this properties:
```js
{
name:jhon smith,
title: ceo/founder/manager,
company: xyz llc,
email: jhon@in.co,
phone: 122312,
website: abc.com,
linkedin: ln.com/asdasd,
city: asdasd,
state: asasd,
country: USA
}
```

## Cold email process
---

caleb then use lemlist, which is an auto cold dming platform\
he connect his linkedin & gmail account, and plug the lead list csv file. and write a cold dm templates that he wants to send to those leads.

his email,

**==first email==**\
**sub:** Need any help with your content {{firstName}}?\
Hey {{firstname}},\
Hope you are well.\
Do you need any help with your content strategy at {{companyName}}?\
Let me know if you do.\
caleb,\
{{signature, email, website, social, address}}

**==second email/follow up==** *(usually sends after 2days of not responding)* \
**sub:** Did you miss this?\
Hey {{firstname}},
Just following up in case my last email got buried in your inbox.\
Do you need any help with your content strategy?

I create content specifically for finance brands and think we could work well together.\
If you're interested, let me know.\
Have a great day.\
caleb\
{{signature, email, website, social, address}}


> [!tip] use bit of a clickbait-ish headline for subject!
> ex: did you miss this?

**==message on linkedin==**

```
Hey gabriel,
Hope you're doing well, I just sent you an email, but wanted to reach out on here as well.
Do you need any help with your content strategy?
If you do, let me know :)
Caleb
```

then he launches the campaign, and lemlist then auto send dm and email and shows analytics on sent status, read status, replies and other stuff.\
every 20min (adjustable), lemlist will send new email, for 500 leads that caleb inputted there.

caleb's sent schedule: (9am-6pm, mon-fri)

---
## After getting reply
---
most people will ask for past works / samples.\
and ask for a call.

if they dont , caleb recommends you get on a call, anyway. Its a way to get them to know you face to face, get comfortable with you.

essentially, client is looking for is **reassurance**, that you say what you are & you are going to do the work, also your pricing and budget fits in within budget.\
Their either looking to see your professional, and what you are doing and also looking to make sure that you're not going to like rip em off expensive.

==The email you reply to your client with==

```
--(your availability)--
Yes absolutely. I am available all on monday, if that works for you. I also have availability on tuesday.

--(your past work & samples)--
I am a former copywriter at barclays (specifically wealth and investment) and paysafe. and fully understand the importance of accuracy.
some recent article of mine:
link1
link2
Ive also attached a white paper on forex dev in southern asia, which was written for clients.

--(your pricing)--
My pricing is $180 per 1k words or $60/hr (a day rate of $480)

Let me know if that works for you.
Caleb

Sometime, just because the client said yes at first contact, doesn't guarantee the closing, as Caleb showed after sending the above email, he heard back nothing, tried to reach out to but no answer.

Then, Caleb for another lead replying to his email, and this guy was a utuber and had a bad experience with SEO and stuff, they got into a call and,\
client expressed his past experience with other copywriter and Caleb reassured him and convince him he is a professional, did this type work in the past, brought these results and closed a deal.

Its not always a clean cut process, there blip along the way, just be consistent.\
It takes a long time, you have to meet these clients & build a relationship with them, nurture them, build trust with them. 

Its not about getting people sold immediately, its about taking one step at a time.

Now they've got a content plan and Caleb did an initial article and asked for review. Even if you're an expert, do further research on the topic and start working.
