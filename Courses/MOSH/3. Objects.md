>[!tip] we can use object to group related variable & func.

## object-literal 

using curly braces.

```js 

let circle = { // object literal syntax
radius: 1,
location: {
	x:1,
	y:2,
	}
draw: function(){}
move: function(){}
}

circle.draw(); // method

```

> *if a function is a part of an object, we call that func. a method*


## factory fn.

just like a factory produces product, factory fn. produces object.

```js
// what if we need another circle obj, we dont wanna redo everything again, we use factory fn for that

function createCircle(rad,x,y){

return { // object literal syntax
radius: rad,
location: {
		x:x,
		y:y,
	}
	
	// draw: function(){} 
	draw(){}

 }

}

const circle1 = createCircle(1,2,4)
const circle2 = createCircle(11,12,14)

// as we create more circle, there's only one place to modify our draw method, what a timesaver!
```

## constructor fn.

 the job of a constructor fn. is to create a function.\
but there's a naming convention, pascal notation

```js

function Circle(rad){

this.rad = rad;
this.draw = function(){}

// in js, the this keyword is a reference to the object that is executing this piece of code.

// for now, lets imagine this refers to an empty object {}

// as obj is dynamic in js, we can set additional properties, even after its initialization

}

// when we use new operator 3 things happens:
// - it creates an empty js obj , ex: const x = {}

// - it will set `this` to point the new empty obj

// - finally, it will return this new populated object from the Circle func., for this reason we dont explictly write the return statement
 
const circle = new Circle(1);

```


## Dynamic Nature of Object

in JS objects are dynamic, which means,\
when you create them, you can always add new properties or methods, or remove existing ones.

```js

const circle = {
radius: 1;
}

//adding new prop & method
circle.color = "yellow";
circle.draw = function(){}

delete circle.color;
delete circle.draw;


```

>[!danger] one thing about `const`
> `const` means we cannot `re-asssign`, but we can always change/modify. Like adding or removing properties.
> 
> ```js
> const circle = {} 
> circle = {} // reassigning
> // we get typeError: cannot assign to const variable  
>  
>  ```

## Constructor property

Every object in js, has a property called `constructor`. And that ***references the function that was used to construct or create that object***.

```js

//constructor fn
function Circle(rad){
this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}
}

const another = new Circle(1) 

//this returns the circle function that we used to create this object
another.constructor // shows the whole func. with body


//factory fn
function createCircle(r){
return{r, draw:function(){}}
}

const circle1 = createCircle(3) 

circle1.constructor // ƒ Object() { [native code] } we get this

// we can see blue ƒ and the name is uppercase, this is a built in constructor function in js

// as we returned an object from our factory func. using object literal syntax, internally it was created using the Object constructor fn.
```

when you create object using object literal syntax, internally the js engine uses this constructor fn.

when we use object literal syntax, js does this:
```js
let x = {}

// js engine translate that to this;
// let x = new Object();

```

```js
// more built in constructor fn

// constructor  // literals
new String()   // '',"",``
new Boolean() // true, false
new Number() // 1,2,4...
```

**Takeaway**\
>[!info] every object has a constructor property, and that references a function that was used to create this object.

## functions are objects

in vscode, when we use the dot notation after the name of the fn, we get autocomplete modal showing the properties and methods

purple icon are methods, blue icon are properties

```js

function Circle(rad){
this.rad = rad;
this.draw  = function(){}
}

Circle.name // returns the name of the fn
Circle.length // returns the number of args of the fn

// every obj has constructor properties and that references the fn that was used to create this object

Circle.constructor // ƒ Function() { [native code] }

// we see that a built-in constructor called Function was used to create this Circle constructor fn


```

>[!info] as we declare Circle constructor function using the `function` keyword syntax, internally js engine will use this function constructor to create this object.
