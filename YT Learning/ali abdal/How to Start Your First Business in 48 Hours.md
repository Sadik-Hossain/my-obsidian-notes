### How do you start your first business?

0:00

All right, so how do you start your first business in a weekend?

0:03

That is what Noah Kagan purports to teach us in this book Million Dollar Weekend,

0:06

which is what we're discussing in this episode of Book Club,

0:08

the ongoing series where I distill and discuss highlights and summaries

0:11

from some of my favorite books.

0:12

And genuinely, this is a absolutely fantastic book to read

0:15

if you are an aspiring entrepreneur.

0:17

If you've ever thought that you want to start your own business

0:19

and you have not yet done it, you need to read this book

0:21

because it's going to give you a play-by-play roadmap

0:23

on how exactly to do that.

0:24

Okay, so the book is broken down into three parts.

0:26

We've got part one, start it.

0:28

Part two, build it.

0:29

And part three, grow it.

0:30

And in this video, I'm going to focus on part one and two,

0:32

start it and build it.

### Start it

0:34

Let's go.

0:35

If you're watching this and you haven't yet started your business,

0:37

I suspect, for a lot of people I know,

0:39

you might have been thinking about starting a business for several years.

0:42

You have just not yet taken action.

0:43

And there is this pervasive myth that happens amongst

0:47

everyone who is an aspiring entrepreneur,

0:48

which is, I need the right idea.

0:50

I cannot get started until I have the right idea.

0:53

But the thing is, and what Noah talks about throughout the book,

0:56

is you don't start a business by first having the right idea

1:00

and then starting the business.

1:01

You start a business by deciding to start a business

1:04

and then you find a process to come up with the right idea.

1:07

And really, the core message he's sharing this first chapter,

1:09

which is why it's called a chapter one,

1:10

just f***ing start,

1:12

is begin before you are ready.

1:14

No one feels ready to start a business.

1:16

Just like I've heard, no one really feels ready to have kids.

1:18

The timing is never quite right.

1:19

Similarly, the timing to start a business is never quite right.

1:22

You have to just start.

1:23

You have to begin before you're ready.

1:24

And just to labour this point just a little bit more,

1:26

there's a nice quote here.

1:27

Most people overthink first, act later.

1:30

Every successful entrepreneur, act first, figure it out later.

1:34

Any analysis ahead of action is purely speculation.

1:37

You really do not understand something until you've done it.

1:40

Rather than trying to plan your way into the confidence to act,

1:43

just start acting.

1:45

And there is a motto that he talks about here.

1:46

And this is a motto that has really stuck with me

1:49

since I read the book a couple of weeks ago.

1:50

And that motto is, now, not how.

1:53

Whenever we think of doing something, we're like,

1:55

okay, well, I've got this idea for this thing,

1:56

but how do I do it?

1:58

And there's this tyranny of how.

2:00

The how holds us back from doing things.

2:02

Instead, think, what is the smallest action I can take right now?

2:05

Even if you don't know what to do about anything,

2:07

there's probably a small action that you can figure out

2:09

that you can just take action on.

2:10

And then once you've taken action on that,

2:12

you can then get started with the thing.

2:14

So honestly, the whole first chapter is a lot of emotional support.

2:18

Genuinely, I've been running my YouTuber Academy for a few years now.

2:20

We've taught like 5,000 students in it.

2:22

95% of students, when it comes to starting YouTube channels,

2:26

it's not technical things they're struggling with.

2:27

It's the emotional side of things.

2:29

They're like, oh, I couldn't possibly make YouTube videos

2:31

unless I have the perfect idea.

2:32

No one starts making YouTube videos with a perfect idea.

2:34

Just like no one starts a business with the perfect idea.

2:37

You decide to start, and then you can figure out the idea second.

2:40

Now, whatever stage of the business process you're at,

2:42

you're hopefully making some amount of money,

2:44

and then you're gonna need a place to invest that money.

2:46

And that is where the sponsor of this video comes in,

2:47

and that is Trading212.

2:49

Trading212 is a fantastic app that lets you invest in stocks,

2:52

and shares, and funds in a commission-free fashion.

2:55

They've got a bunch of really good features,

2:56

which is why I personally use them to manage a portion of my portfolio.

2:59

So firstly, they've got a great practice mode.

3:01

If you're new to investing, for example,

3:02

you can go on the app and you can make an account for free,

3:04

and you can invest with fake money,

3:06

which actually sort of will track how the market's actually performing.

3:09

And so you can see, would you have made money

3:11

or would you have lost money over a certain period of time

3:13

had you invested actual real cash?

3:15

And then once you're ready, you can always switch it

3:16

from like the fake play video game mode

3:18

into the actual money mode,

3:19

which is obviously what I do,

3:20

because I invest my actual money through Trading212.

3:22

They also have a really good pies and auto-invest feature.

3:25

So basically, there's a bunch of like random people

3:26

who are super into like the stock market analysis,

3:29

and they'll create these pies where they might be like,

3:31

you know, this is a pie of stocks,

3:33

like 30% Apple, 20% Tesla, 10% like, I don't know, Microsoft,

3:37

20% Google, all that kind of stuff.

3:39

And you can browse through these different pies,

3:41

and you can see how they are currently performing

3:43

and how they've historically performed.

3:44

And if you like the idea of a pie

3:46

and you kind of agree with what's going on with it,

3:48

you can actually just copy and paste

3:49

that asset allocation directly into your account,

3:51

and you can invest however much money you want

3:53

in that particular pie.

3:54

Obviously, for the record, the thing that I do,

3:56

not financial advice,

3:57

but generally what most people recommend

3:59

is to just invest in broad stock market index funds.

4:01

But if you're like me,

4:02

and you maybe wanna play around

4:03

with some small percentage of your portfolio,

4:05

then using the pies feature is a great way of dabbling

4:08

with like individual stock picking in that sense.

4:10

They've also recently added support

4:11

for multi-currency accounts.

4:13

So if, for example, you're in the UK

4:14

and you wanna invest in a US stock market index fund

4:16

like the S&P 500, like I do,

4:18

then you won't get hit

4:19

with the annoying foreign exchange fees.

4:20

And if you have an invest or an ISA account,

4:22

then Trading212 also gives you daily interest

4:25

on your uninvested cash in USD or GBP or euros.

4:28

They've got more than 23,000 trust pilot reviews

4:30

with an average rating of over 4.6 stars.

4:32

So they are very reputable.

4:34

And like I said, I've been using them for years

4:35

to manage a portion of my own portfolio.

4:37

And so if any of that sounds up your street,

4:38

then do hit the link in the video description,

4:40

and that will take you to this page

4:41

where you'll be guided on how to sign up for an account.

4:43

And if you use that link,

4:44

you will also get a free share

4:46

up to the value of 100 pounds.

4:47

So it's free money.

4:48

You might as well check out Trading212.

4:49

And thank you so much Trading212

4:51

for sponsoring this video.

4:51

So now that we've gotten the emotional support

### Build it

4:53

side out of the way, that begs the question,

4:55

what happens next?

4:56

And that is where we now come

4:57

to the customer first approach to building a business.

5:00

I have interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs on my podcast,

5:02

spoken to hundreds more in real life.

5:04

And all of them basically talk about this idea,

5:06

this customer first approach,

5:07

which is that you're not trying to find an idea

5:09

for a business.

5:09

Instead, first of all, you're starting with

5:12

who are the people you would like to serve?

5:14

Because fundamentally what a business is,

5:15

a business solves a problem for someone

5:17

who's willing to pay for that problem to be solved.

5:19

And the biggest thing that holds back entrepreneurs

5:23

and has done forever is trying to build something

5:26

without first verifying that there's actually someone

5:29

out there willing to pay for the thing.

5:31

This is the problem that students often have.

5:33

Because students come up with great ideas

5:35

and it's amazing.

5:35

They're like, I have this idea for this business.

5:37

And they'll just go and try and build it

5:38

without first verifying that there are in fact

5:40

people to pay for it.

5:41

Here we go.

5:42

That's why when it comes to generating business ideas,

5:44

customers come first before the product or service.

5:47

Even before the idea.

5:48

To build a business, you need someone to sell to.

5:51

I can't tell you how many times

5:52

someone has emailed me saying,

5:54

what do you think of this business idea?

5:55

I also get those emails.

5:57

My alter reply, have you asked what the customer thinks?

5:59

Basically, when you're trying to start a business,

6:02

the first step is to figure out

6:03

who are you going to sell to?

6:05

And that's ideally within your own zone of influence.

6:08

For example, in my position of being a medical student

6:10

at university, the people I'm serving

6:12

are probably the people around me

6:13

or the parents of the people around me

6:14

or the people I interact with in hospitals

6:16

or the people I interact with at the university

6:17

or the local businesses I interact with.

6:19

That's like within my zone of influence.

6:21

The other good thing that this customer

6:22

should ideally have is money.

6:24

It is so much easier to create a business

6:26

where you are targeting people who have money

6:27

rather than people who don't have money.

6:29

Again, this is one of the issues with students

6:30

is that if you're a student,

6:31

then everyone you know is your age

6:33

and probably does not have very much money.

6:35

If it were me and I were a student starting a business,

6:37

I might be thinking, okay,

6:39

my friends don't have any money,

6:40

but who does?

6:40

Their parents do.

6:41

Okay, what are the problems

6:42

that my friends' parents have?

6:43

Who else has money?

6:44

Like my college or my university,

6:46

there's a pot of money I can tap into there.

6:48

Okay, now that you've brainstormed

6:49

who are the sorts of people ideally with money

6:50

that you'd potentially like to serve,

6:52

the next step is to brainstorm

6:53

what are all of the problems that they have.

6:55

Now, the easiest way to do this

6:56

is to just go and ask them,

6:57

what are the things in their life

6:58

that are really annoying?

6:59

What are the things that they already pay for?

7:01

What are the things where they're paying for something

7:02

but the thing they're paying for doesn't seem very good?

7:04

And if you do this enough,

7:06

you will come up with an infinite list of problems

7:08

that people have.

7:09

And the whole world progresses and evolves

7:11

based on people discovering a problem

7:13

and then trying to find the solution to that problem.

7:15

Uber started because someone complained,

7:17

was like, oh man, it's really annoying

7:18

trying to held out a cab

7:19

and trying to ring the taxi company.

7:20

And so that's where the idea for Uber comes along.

7:22

And there's a really good example here.

7:23

So I love this.

7:24

There's the founder first approach

7:25

and then there's the customer first approach.

7:27

So here we go.

7:28

Let's say you have an idea for a dog walking out.

7:31

How would you go about doing it?

7:32

Here's the way most people,

7:33

most entrepreneurs would do it.

7:35

One, spend hours at home thinking about the app

7:37

and coming up with clever names for it.

7:38

Two, spend $100 hiring their cousin to draw a cool logo.

7:41

Three, set up an LLC.

7:42

Four, watch YouTube videos about apps

7:44

and programming and business and dogs.

7:46

Five, consider signing up for a developer bootcamp

7:48

and quickly realize that coding is hard.

7:49

Six, buy the domain name for the snazzy website

7:52

they're going to build.

7:52

Seven, look into hiring a developer on Upwork

7:54

and quickly realize it's prohibitively expensive.

7:56

Eight, give up again.

7:58

Does that sound familiar?

7:59

That is founder first.

8:01

Now let's take the same idea for a dog walking app

8:03

and let's put it through the customer first perspective.

8:05

One, call or text three people right now who have dogs

8:09

and ask them to pay you to walk their dog.

8:11

Two, turns out none of these dog owners

8:13

have problems walking their dog.

8:15

You discover their real problem is finding dog sitters

8:17

when they're traveling.

8:19

Three, ask for the next travel dates

8:20

and have them pay you a deposit.

8:22

They pay jackpot.

8:23

And the idea here is that quickly,

8:25

based on this really simple example

8:26

which I think we can all relate to in some ways,

8:28

in the founder first approach,

8:29

you go down a rabbit hole

8:30

where you build this thing

8:31

without verifying that people actually have the problem

8:33

and are willing to pay for it.

8:34

In the second one, you come up with an idea, cool.

8:37

Then you talk to people and you see,

8:39

does the idea have legs?

8:40

Would they be willing to pay you for it?

8:42

You realize, no, they don't.

8:43

And now you do something else

8:44

because you realize they are willing to pay you

8:45

for this other thing.

8:46

And crucially, you ask for that first sale.

8:48

You make that first dollar.

8:49

The first dollar is always the hardest.

8:50

The first three customers are always the hardest.

8:52

If you just aim to try and get

8:54

your first three paying customers

8:56

as soon as is humanly possible

8:58

before you even try and build anything,

9:00

then at least you have some kind of validation

9:02

that the idea has legs.

9:03

So this, for example, is an email

9:05

that one of Noah's friends, Boris, sent.

9:07

Subject, helping you help me with food.

9:09

Hey friends, one thing I realized

9:10

is that I'm busy all the time

9:12

and I don't have time to cook a quality meal.

9:14

I wanted to invite a few close friends

9:16

to test a business idea with me.

9:17

Consider yourself the lucky chosen few, smiley face.

9:20

Convenient and home-cooked meals.

9:22

On February 9th, for $20,

9:23

there will be a personal chef making us food

9:25

and delivering it to you conveniently and deliciously.

9:27

If this is something you're seriously interested in,

9:30

please PayPal $20.

9:31

Open to all and any feedback.

9:33

Cheers, Boris.

9:34

P.S. Please let me know

9:35

if you have any dietary requirements, et cetera.

9:37

I promise the dinner will be delish,

9:38

exclamation mark, exclamation mark, exclamation mark.

9:41

This is how you validate the idea for a business.

9:44

You know, you might have a business idea

9:45

and at a party you say to someone,

9:46

oh, I'm thinking of starting a business around bloody blah.

9:48

Would you be interested?

9:50

Social etiquette dictates

9:51

that they basically have to say yes.

9:53

You're very unlikely to meet someone

9:54

who will actually say,

9:55

no, I won't get about that.

9:57

But here's the crucial bit.

9:58

If you ask them for money,

9:59

be like, oh, okay, cool.

10:00

Well, you know, I'm taking pre-orders now.

10:02

Would you be willing to pay me $20 for it?

10:04

Now you see how good your idea actually is

10:06

because no one is gonna part with their money

10:08

unless they actually believe in the idea.

10:10

Words are cheap, money is not.

10:12

So if someone says, yeah, I like your business idea,

10:15

that means jackal.

10:16

What matters is, are they actually paying for it?

10:18

Have they pre-ordered the thing?

10:20

Would they be willing to be your first customer

10:22

for a 50% discount with a money back guarantee?

10:24

Anything like that.

10:25

Now, the other way to get business ideas

10:26

is to also look to your own problems.

10:28

If you find something is a problem for you,

10:30

chances are it'll be a problem for other people as well.

10:33

And there are four prompts that Noah gives us

10:34

that I fully agree with

10:35

that help us figure out what our own problems are.

10:37

So firstly, what is one thing this morning that irritated me?

10:40

Secondly, what is one thing on my to-do list

10:42

that's been there for over a week?

10:44

Thirdly, what is one thing that I regularly fail to do well?

10:47

And fourthly, what is one thing I wanted to buy recently

10:50

only to find out that no one made it?

10:51

And these sorts of prompts help you think about

10:53

like the problems in your own life.

10:55

You should sort of become a magnet for problems.

10:57

Like as you go through life,

10:59

anytime you find something annoying,

11:01

what an aspiring entrepreneur

11:02

or an actual entrepreneur does is they recognize,

11:05

I'm finding this thing annoying.

11:06

I have just identified a problem.

11:08

And a problem with a solution is a business,

11:10

assuming people are willing to pay for that solution.

11:12

Whereas what most people do is like,

11:13

they will just come across a problem

11:15

and they'll be like, oh yeah, it's just a thing.

11:17

Oh yeah, it's really annoying that we have to fill out

11:18

these like feedback forms in our lectures.

11:21

And that's where the idea will stop.

11:22

What I used to do in med school was,

11:23

oh man, it's really annoying

11:24

that we've got to fill out

11:25

those feedback forms in lectures.

11:26

I wonder if there would be

11:27

a more efficient way of doing that.

11:28

If we found the right person,

11:29

we could build a solution to this.

11:30

And when I was in med school,

11:31

I was unsophisticated with this.

11:33

I was like, oh, how might I build this?

11:34

I knew how to code.

11:35

I knew how to make websites and apps and stuff.

11:36

So I would default to like,

11:38

just trying to build the thing.

11:39

I've wasted years of my life chasing business ideas

11:42

where I was like, I found an idea,

11:44

I'm going to build the thing.

11:45

And I didn't find any customers

11:46

to pay for the bloody thing.

11:48

And I really, if someone had told me this when I was 13,

11:50

I would literally say seven years of my life

11:52

chasing down random rabbit holes

11:54

because I was afraid or didn't realize

11:56

I could speak to people

11:57

and actually just ask them for money.

11:58

The main thing is that honestly,

12:00

the way you start a business these days

12:01

is that you try and get people to pay for the thing

12:04

before you make the thing.

12:05

People come to me and they're like,

12:06

hey, Ali, I've got a bit of an audience.

12:07

I want to make an online course.

12:08

And I'm always like, okay, cool.

12:10

I know that the temptation is there to build the course

12:13

and then sell it in that order,

12:15

but you should flip that around.

12:17

You should sell the course and then build it.

12:19

So if for example, you're thinking,

12:21

you know, maybe your audience wants a course

12:22

on how to build the perfect productive desk setup.

12:25

You could go out and spend like a month

12:27

or two or three trying to create the course.

12:29

That would be a terrible idea.

12:30

Instead, what you should do is pre-sell it.

12:32

You can whip up a landing page in like a Google doc

12:36

in maybe half a day.

12:37

You can send it out to people in your audience

12:38

and be like, hey, potentially working on this course

12:41

about how to have a productive desk setup.

12:43

If this sounds interesting,

12:44

you can pre-order the course here.

12:46

It'll be released in the next month

12:47

and I'll give you your money back if you don't like it.

12:48

50% off, something to that effect.

12:50

Because based on how the pre-sell goes,

12:53

if enough people want to buy it,

12:54

then it gives you an idea.

12:55

It lets you validate the market.

12:56

So it's about finding a problem,

12:58

finding someone who's willing to pay

12:59

for the solution to that problem,

13:01

talking to those people quite a lot,

13:03

getting money from them.

13:04

And only once you have done that,

13:06

do you know that, okay,

13:07

this is a business idea worth pursuing.

13:09

And now you can start to build the thing

13:10

because you already have paying customers.

13:12

This is the thing that I wish I had known

13:13

when I started my entrepreneurship journey.

13:15

This is the thing I wish is a message

13:16

that could be hammered into the heads

13:18

of every single aspiring entrepreneur out there.

13:20

I give so many talks these days around the world.

13:22

It's super fun.

13:22

And there's always like half the audience

13:24

are aspiring entrepreneurs.

13:25

And they're all stuck in this thing of like,

13:27

oh, I need to have a good business idea

13:28

or, oh, I've just been building this thing,

13:30

but like I haven't built it yet.

13:32

And I need to make my MVP first.

13:33

And then all of it is a total waste of time.

13:36

If you speak to people who are second time founders,

13:38

people who have started multiple companies,

13:40

you'll find they spend the majority of their time

13:43

just talking to customers.

13:44

The more you talk to your customers,

13:45

the more you validate the idea actually has a market.

13:48

The more you understand what problems they have,

13:49

the more you can start to see,

13:51

huh, maybe I thought this thing should be red,

13:52

but actually this thing is blue.

13:54

The more you try and ask them for money

13:55

to pre-sell the thing that you haven't even built yet,

13:58

the more likely you are to succeed in the business.

14:00

Honestly, I think you should totally read the book.

14:01

It's absolutely amazing.

14:02

Noah's done a smashing job of it.

14:03

And if you liked this video

14:04

and you wanna see a way deeper dive into this,

14:06

I actually have an interview with Noah Kagan

14:08

on the Deep Dive podcast

14:09

that will be linked right over here.

14:10

Thank you so much for watching

14:10

and I'll see you in the next video.

14:11

Bye-bye.
