> [!tip] Prospect -> Outreach -> Follow up
## The process
- **Get leads from fiverr (harlan)**\
	you get a spreadsheet of peoples with:
	names, title, company, email, website, linkedin, location
- **send them email, follow-up email, reach out to linkedin**
- **get them on a sales call & diagnose their situation & desired result**
- **validate & qualify, make sure there's no misunderstandings**
- **provide them with different options and close a deal**

## The harsh truth
---
People are looking for a copywriter or they're not.\
You're not going to convince them, that they need it at this point or not.\
You're pretty much scouting & knocking on the door and saying,\
"do you need a writer?"

**email template**\
**sub:**\
`Need any help with your content {Name}?`\
**body:**
```
Hi {NAME},

CurrencyTransfer came up for me on Linkedin and I think you have a great website.

Are there any marketing plans you have, like creating some extra landing pages or email campaigns? I'd love to help with them.

I'm sure you've thought about a blog too, which would be great for SEO.

Let me know if you think I can be of use, and we can have a discussion over the phone or via email.

Here is my Linkedin:

All the best,

Hi Caleb,

I've just posted a job on Upwork:

I'm currently going through potential candidates on this platform so we can start working on paid-test projects for our blog.

How much do you charge per hour/project?

Cheers

Hey Florence,

Thanks for the extra information.

I've just measured some of the blogs on Currency Transfer and they seem to be around 1,000-1,200 words, depending on the category.

The price would depend on how much research I am required to do and whether it needs to be SEO optimised. I normally charge around £50-100 per blog (which equates to 5-10p a word or £25 p/h), depending on these factors. Does that work for you? We can negotiate a price within this range.

If you send me a brief for a paid test, then I would love to give it a try. I can start straight away.

FYI, when I was at Paysafe, I wrote several articles for Skrill News (one of their digital wallets).

Here is one I wrote on FX: link

Thanks!

Caleb
