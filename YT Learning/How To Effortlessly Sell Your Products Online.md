## Two Things

There are Two Things, that are responsible for successful online business:
- delivery
- positioning

Number one is the delivery of the offer,\
That's the thing that people are actually going to get, when they invest with you and become a client. This is what they are getting.

The second thing, however, alongside delivery, is the positioning of that offer

and the positioning. Wraps around the delivery.

The positioning, your marketing, the way you're putting it out into the marketplace, the way you would describe being your product or your program is what actually sells someone on the offer.

**it's the positioning that's going to sell it.**

Â you will not have the opportunity to deliver for anyone unless you learn the positioning.

so, what we need to do is figure out, how do we create an offer that is positioned so well that draws people in\
and then we have the chance to actually deliver for them.
