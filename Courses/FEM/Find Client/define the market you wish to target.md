> [!quote] The internet is noisy, and your marketing will be lost unless targeted at a specific audience. In this section, we will explore how to do precisely that.


we have to decide,\
who do we wanna work with?\
who we wanna market to?

## Why you need to segment your market? / why its important to specialize

**Less Competition**\
The more specialized you are, the fewer others can offer what you offer. That means, less competition & less pitching for work.

**Seen as an expert**\
by specializing in your area, you're seen as an expert in your particular field. You become the "go-to" person for that work.

 **Higher fees**\
Because, fewer people can do what you do to the same standard, you can charge more.


==Specialty in terms of the group that we are reaching out to.==\
we are not talking about specializing in WordPress or tech stack.\
we are talking about the type of audience we wanna serve/help/reach. (ex: charitable website)

>[!tips] Specializing means focusing on specific audience
>Focusing on a particular audience / sector, in order to get their attention. There has to be very small well-defined niched audience.


- **tailoring our msg**\
	because, we are focusing on a **specific audience**, we can tailor the messaging to **better resonate** with them. We can talk about their pain points, their issues, their problems
- **Being heard more often**\
	as you are constantly targeting the same grp of people, they will hear from you more often & come to know your name.
- **Become the go-to person**\
	as you demonstrate an understanding of your audience's challenges, you will become seen as the go-to person for that sector.

we will create a separate campaign with a landing page, **aimed at the type of audience you are trying to reach.**


> [!tip] Its not about you, Its about audience
> your offer, your messages should always resonate with the audience, their pains, struggles, desire, needs.
> Position yourself in a way, that your audience feel you understand them.

### Take It Slow

- Jumping into a specialism can be risky until you know it works, Take it slow.
- Do not redesign your website to focus exclusively on specialism. If you do, you will lose work outside of that area.
- Instead, create a separate campaign with a landing page aimed at the audience you are trying to reach.

> [!fail] Stop redesigning your website every 5mins, it will not help
> Your failure to win new work is not because of your website.\
> Its because, **you are not targeting the right audience & providing them with value regularly.**


## How to find minimum viable audience

This is the smallest group of people we can find, that is capable of generating of enough work to keep us busy for 2-3 yrs.

This audience has to have to certain characteristics for this work well.\


### they Boost or amplify your voice

There are some sectors/ groups of people has a strong sense of community.

they communicate with each other (ex: developers). They share a lot, they interact with each other, they have community group/server, conference/events, blogs/forum etc.\
By working there, your work/delivery are more likely to get handed around the sector and get promoted.

There are other sectors who are highly competitive with one another. They dont talk to another, in those you are not gonna get the same amplification. 

**so, we wanna work for sectors, that have a lil bit of community in it.**

**Can they afford you?**\
before worrying about anything else, you need to establish whether they can afford your service or the size of client you wish to target.

**Do they move around?**\
How long do people stay in a company? If they regularly move on within the same sector, your reputation will move on with them.

**Do they talk to one another?**\
some sectors are very protective of their intellectual property, so there is little communication between companies, others are very open, you want the latter.

**Is there a community**\
Does the sector have dedicated blogs, mailing list, conferences, and online communities? These are excellent forums for you to reach members of your target audience. Sector where community assemble. Go to those places, where you can find them\
(ex: developer -> stack overflow, discord, forum, conference, blog writing, comments)

**Are there influencers in the community?**\
Are their figures within the community who are already well known and respected? Do they seem approachable and friendly?

become a big part of the community just by joining in and offering help/advice.

### Don't be afraid to go really niche

**have more than one sector**\
Remember, you are not limited to a single sector, once you have exhausted the potential with one group, move on to another. But, at first instead of focusing on everything, laser focus on one.

**Minimum criteria**\
it is viable as long as a sector has a handful of publications, events or communities and approximately a thousand potential companies.

**Consider your own experience**\
Look at your previous clients & experience, are there any reoccurring sectors, do you have any good contacts in a particular sector?

Also, its important that you're passionate about a sector / enjoying working on. (ex; ecomm, blog websites)


3 sectors Paul Boag targeted:\
- UK Charities
- UK Heritage
- UK Universities

before getting a client for universities, paul joined university mailing list and research & find all their problems challenges, struggles.\
And overtime, he found questions that he can answer, so he wrote up his answer and sent it to the guy who mails and asked can he post this?
And, the guy said, "yeah, sure! you found a solution, go for it."

Then he find out, there's a conference, so he asked can he come? they allowed it, brought people drink.\
then, over the time, he asks can he give a talk? they allowed it but said as long as you don't sell anything.

So he kept doing it like that, always a foot on the door. Built trust and relationship and eventually he got a deal.


### Research Your sectors and pick a winner

**Create two lists**\
you got one/three sector(s) in your head, that you think its right fit for you. 

For each of your sectors create 2 lists:

---

--- start-multi-column: ID_tf5j
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 2
Largest Column: standard
border: off
```

>[!example] Influencers
This list includes individuals, events, blogs, communities and membership organizations. 


--- column-end---


> [!example] Clients
> This is a list of prospective clients you would like to work within this sector. 



--- end-multi-column

---


> [!tip] Membership org are hidden gem
> They list all their members on site. It shows us whos in the sector.
> (ex: skool, patreon, fb group)


> [!NOTE] Things to collect
> - Name
> - company
> - Url
> - Email
> - Socials (linkedin/twitter/insta)


**What we want to know about sectors you are considering**\
- [ ] what conference do they have?
- [ ] Do they have smaller scale meetups?
- [ ] Do they have on or offline publications?
- [ ] Are there mailing lists or forums?
- [ ] Can you find any influencers?

When you are compiling those lists, bear all the above in mind.

**Finding key players**\
mostly individuals, publications, goto person/source etc.

- You can google it by sectors, mix and match words like conference, meetup, member orgs, blogs. Also, pay attention to who is advertising on your sector keywords. Because, **those who advertises have money.**
- If you have existing clients in the sector, ask them what publication they read, event they attended and communities they participate in. Their favorite expert/idol/person they listen to, look upto.



> [!tip] Use Linkedin as a research tools
> search on sector you're after, see who comes up. Not only on LinkedIn but also other social media.

**Identify some prospective clients**

Identify a list of about 30-50 specifications organizations you want to work with.

Start with companies you know & like.

Add recommendations from personal contacts.

Add connections from LinkedIn.


**Identifying your initial contact points**\
identify the specific people we want to contact at these organizations.

Make an educated guess about the role.\
for paul, its customer service **director**, engineer **manager**, marketing **director**, **head** of digital,  people like that.

ideally we want to contact a specific person in each company, rather than using their generic contact address.

To do that, we need to identify the role of the person we want to contact.

The role will depend on the org's size, structure & sectors. It will also depend on the services you provide.

- **In smaller companies, go for the founder.** That person is the key decision maker for most cases.
- single product companies, aim for the **digital leads or head of marketing/IT**.
- Multi-product companies will get complicated. (nightmare for starters, avoid it if you can.)



**Find the right name**\
Once you know the role of the person to contact, view the company page on linkedin & search for that role.

Alternatively, search on the company website or via google.

~ Head of {marketing}
~ Director of {marketing}
~ {marketing} lead


**Can't find a name?**\
reach out to somebody else in the company and ask.\
you don't wanna say, I'm looking for head of marketing, because of I wanna sell something\
say something like, I'm doing a research.

Failing that, try emailing at catch all email address. most companies has inquiry email address, mail there.

If all fails, Try another role or another company.

**Find their email address**\
You can guess at an email address by looking at the email of other people in the company, you can validate that email online using tools like emailhippo.\
if its formatted {first name,lastname@comany} youre good to go.

Alternatively, you can use email lookup service like {findthatlead.com}

You can reach out to via linkedin DM also.
