You either help them or entertain them

You have to understand human nature, persuasive writing.

Help is more important than entertainment 

###### Help them by providing values:

- solutions of a problem
- tips & tricks & life hacks
- step by step guides
- do's and don't 
- pro's and con's 
- useful, helpful resources/info/knowledge 
- more ...

###### Entertain them via:

- humor
- memes


**Grow audience via values, gain traffics, gain attention**

Then drive those traffic into your products/business 

**Comment to gain more visibility, make yourself available in the raider**

Post valuable, helpful, resourceful content

##### Always ask yourself:

what is the one thing I want my reader to learn from this post?
What is the one thing you want to teach in this post? 

That's your hook every time.

**The hook, makes a promise and by the end of the post it delivers on that promise.**

step number one, is the hook.
But retention is the rehook.
**attention means nothing without retention, especially in online content**.
Everyone can read that first line, but how do you get them to read till the end?

These two methods of writing a rehook, first one where you add heft, where you address a common objection, and the other one where you say something completely opposite.

**Writing is simply get people to buy into an idea, to buy into an opinion**

Associate a problem, make the readers feel **resonate** with you.
