description: "René Rodriguez is entertaining, but he is NOT an entertainer. His clients describe him as “powerful”, “thought provoking”, and “authentic”. They say things like, “you could hear a pin drop as everyone was so captivated.” Rene’s engaging speaking style, backed by his scientific approach, makes him a top-rated speaker at every event.  For the last 20 years, René has researched and applied behavioral neuroscience as a dynamic keynote speaker, leadership advisor, world class sales expert, and renowned speaker coach. Yet, he believes that we are only scratching the surface of what is possible and that every profession can benefit from fully engaging human mind/brain."
