> **Discovery** ->**conversion** -> **1st time proof of delivery** -> **continued trust**

<u>**Discovery Phase**</u><br>
This is the attraction phase.<br>
How do you get a client, by attracting to you?
via Marketing.<br>
making contents, helpful post/ resource, social engagement (like, comments, share, DM)

the objective is to get as much as eyes as possible.


<u>**Conversion Phase**</u><br>
someone's responded to ad/ they are interested/ knocking in DM to know more, these are called leads.

they are coming as a lead & your job is to convert them to sales. <br>
attracting is not enough, convert them to sales.

<u>**1st time proof of delivery**</u><br>
you deliver the project/work u agreed to.

<u>**Continued trust**</u><br>
If you've done one good work, brought them the results they seek, then trust is built.

And they are more likely to inclined to work with you.

##### pitfalls
- discovery is competitive, everyone is fighting for attention
- sales & conversion are unreliable. just because, you have 200 leads, doesn't mean you have 200 customers that will pay.
- first delivery is always on discount, (bring them results or don't pay at all)
- continued trust -- relationship maintenance, quality of service, progress reporting  once in a while, continuous communication of the work. that's the communication overhead.

Finding a good developer/editor is not hard.<br>
Technology is getting more accessible, so many options are available.
