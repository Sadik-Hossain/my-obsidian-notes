## How to starting writing online with zero audience?

The platforms not broken, the market is not saturated, and you're not late to the party.

The problem is:
- you haven't written long enough
- you haven't figured out yet, what resonates with people.
- who you are trying to reach
- who you are trying to help

And this is the hardest part when starting anything new, embrace to suck, embracing the fact that you don't know yet.\
AndÂ you have to go on the Journey of discovering and figuring that out.

==Just start & be consistent.==

## what makes a good story impactful and valuable?
the simple answer is, what makes a story impactful and valuable is\
if the reader can see themselves in it.

if the reader can't see themselves in it, it's not a very good story.

and a lot of times you see why most "*business content*" trends to not be very good, is because there's all of this belief that circulates in the business world of, your story is important!

you have to tell your story\
your startup story\
your founder story

and the reality is nobody cares! your story is not what matters.

the only time your story matters,\
as if you can ==tell it in a way, that makes the reader be able to see themselves in it.==

you have to use your story as an example\
your story is not what's in the spotlight, your story is an example.

and so what you need to start with instead is.\
==what is the reader interested in and how can you use your story as an example.==

let's say,\
I built a recruiting company and everyone around me is saying, "Cole you need to tell your story, your story of how you built this."

well, if I walk around and say,\
hey everyone! listen to my story about how I built this recruiting company.\
nobody cares!

but if I change who's in the spotlight and I say,\
"hey reader! I'm going to put you in the spotlight\
are you interested in building a recruiting company?\
do you work in recruiting and do you want to know how to grow a really successful recruiting company?

well, I can tell you. because, for example,\
I built a recruiting company.

that is the only difference and all you did was instead of putting the spotlight on me, I'm going to put the spotlight on the reader.\
and I'm going to ==put the spotlight on the reader's wants, needs, interests and desires.==

and then I'm going to use my story as an example.

## what advice do you have for someone who loves to learn but can't figure out what their offer?

so in this question it's,\
how do I figure out what my offer is? AKA what to offer other people?\
when I really love learning AKA I love being selfish to put it bluntly. I love focusing on what I like to focus on.

and these are two completely different things\
and what you have to recognize is that figuring out a compelling offer, often has very little to do with what you care about.

not saying that you should go build an offer or build a product or a service around something, that you have zero interest in.

what I'm saying is that,\
when you start from a place of, here's what I'm interested in\
you immediately miss the point of offer creation.

and the real art of offer creation is, you taking the back seat and instead start from a place of,\
what do other people need?\
what do other people care about?

the way that you figure out what other people need is,\
by going and talking to other people.

so if you don't know,\
what your Niche is?\
what industry you want to be in?\
who you can help?

the single easiest place to start is,\
who do you know, who's struggling with something, that you know how to do it?

could be a friend that just bought a house & their yard is a mess and they don't know how to cut their lawn.\
if you know, how to cut their lawn, congratulations!\
you have an offer.

because, your offer is,\
hey, you don't know how to cut your lawn, would you like me to cut your lawn for you?

yes, that is an offer! 

if you want to do something in the digital world,\
and you want to help X person solve y problem to unlock Z outcome

go find a bunch of those people online and DM them and email them and talk to them\
and be like I'll do it for free.

I just want to understand like how can I help you\
I have ideas for how I can help you.

==you have to start from what the other person values, not from what you're interested in learning about.==

in an Ideal World, there is an overlap. not saying "chase the money" and do something that's unfulfilling to you.

there should be an overlap, but ==often times that overlap reveals itself as you help other people.==


## What Industry to pick?

every single industry can work!

the reality is that, every single person in every single industry, who wants more customers needs a ghost writer.

it doesn't matter what the industry is\
the only thing that matters is,\
who is their customer? and how can you help them Reach or speak to more of
those customers with writing. that's it!

starting with, what industry do you have an information advantage in AKA\
what is an industry where,
you already know the lingo.\
you already speak the language.\
you already understand all the industry terms.\

ideally, this would be an industry that you've worked in or this is an industry that you're a hobbyist in.

like for example,\
it'd be very easy for someone to ghost write for people in gaming. because, that person was a Pro Gamer as a teenager and really understand that space quite a bit.\
It would be very hard for that person to go straight in an industry that he/she knows absolutely nothing about. For example, writing for mineral Rock business.

if he/she don't know anything about mineral rocks, but the person who is obsessed with that and been collecting mineral rocks for 20 years. they're going to know how to ghost write that content better than them.

==so, you always want to start with some sort of Industry where you have an information advantage.==


## How to get first client?

how do you get that first?

==your Niche is your network==

your Niche is not,\
let me go pick some hyper specific category and position myself as an authority.

in the very beginning,\
your first client should be someone you know or someone who knows someone, that's it! *(friends n family, friends of friends)*

could be uncle that always complains at Thanksgiving, about how no one reads his newsletter.\
it's the cousin posting on X or LinkedIn.

you can tell they're trying to drive traffic to their startup, but they're not doing good job.\
it's the friend that is like, "hey! I'm thinking about leaving my job and starting this thing. but, I don't know how to do it."

you're looking for people in your life, that you can help and sometimes that means being paid in cash or paid in a testimonial or being paid in you getting experience or you building confidence.

so that first ghost writing client chances are is sitting right next to you somewhere in your life.\
but in your brain you think,
no! my first client is going to be and then you project this big fancy vision of what it means to land a client off in the future. and that's not what it is.

your first client should just be someone in your life, that you know and you go help them and then you lead that work up to the next one and to the next one into the next one. *(referrals, word of mouth)*

==so in the very beginning, your Niche is your network.==
