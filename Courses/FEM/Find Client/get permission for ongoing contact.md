## why ongoing communication matters 

Our survey and report may have got us on our audience's radar, but we need to stay there and continue to build credibility in the minds of our audience.

We need to be able to show them how great we are, okay? Then you can tell somebody, yeah, I'm an amazing developer, I do all this great work or whatever. But that is not as valuable as them discovering that from sales based on what they've learned about you, what they've heard about you, what they've read, that you've said, those kinds of things.

>[!tip] stay front and center in people's minds 
>it's essential, that we stay front and center in people's minds\
>so that, when they need our services, we're instantly their preferred supplier.

So it's those two things that we need to stay front and center in the minds, **we need to build credibility**. And that's where regular contact via email can provide that.

That's why on my website, at the bottom of every single page, you've got a call to action to sign up to my mailing list, cuz once I've got you on my mailing list, I've gotcha. That's it, you are at my mercy. 

**how do we gain the permission that we need?**

***Promote the report***\
the number one thing that we wanna do is we wanna promote the report.\
So we're gonna contact our audience and tell them about the report. And we're also gonna reach out to those influencers

***provide an email course***\
In addition to that, alongside the report, we probably want to offer a short email course that dives a little bit deeper into the issues that are found in the report. \
Its not extra work. It's regurgitating what's in the report and adding a bit more detail.

so you've downloaded the report. Now, you get these kind of series of introductory emails. And then once you've had that emails, then you're going on to that ongoing advice.

***Provide ongoing advice***\
So after people finish the course, they will continue to hear from you via monthly emails forever or bi-weekly or whatever you decide to do.

So really, the report is done, that's your upfront work, piece of work done. Then we're gonna put together a short email course that only ever needs to be done once.

And then when people sign up, they're gonna get those over a series of weeks. So once you've done all of that, then really, your kind of week to week marketing is literally just doing those ongoing newsletters.


## Designing a landing page that encourages permission

**Landing page objectives**
- Establish your credibility.\
	why do I want emails from this person?\
	Why do I care about what they do?
- create a desire for the course & report
	show people why that is worth having
- Encourage signups

At this stage, it is not about selling your services.\
This is not the place to promote yourself, which means that we probably don't want to make this a part of our existing website

the minute you integrate it alongside your services and the stuff you're selling, it's suddenly all feels a lot more salesy.

And I wanna focus it just on your giving away free advice. So you probably don't wanna do it.\
But you can reuse the design, if you want to, that's not a problem.

## Landing page content
So, what needs to go on this landing page?

***About***\
Outline the main topics of the report & email course and a couple of the key findings.
You provide an outline of the main topics, the report covers, and what the email course will cover.\
And you maybe share a couple of key findings to get people interested.

ex:\
The three highest ranking sites based on our criteria were, find out how you ranked that kind of thing.

***Benefits***
- instant access to the report
- actionable advice for improving your site
- awareness of the competitive landscape
- evidence to support your requests to management.
- Insights into areas of innovation,


***Credibility***\
Write a couple of short sentences about your credibility and the various sources that contributed to the report.\
then create a compelling call to action. So this is the call to action that goes on my own website.

## what does a good call to action need to have on your landing page?

- be clear on what people will get
- consider charging for non-subscribers
- consider making it free for a limited period
- tackle any objections people may have

It needs to be clear about what people are gonna get.

So in Paul's case,\
his generic mailing list is: Improve Your Knowledge of User Experience Design, Digital Marketing and Digital Leadership.\
And then it says,\
you're gonna get emails every one to two weeks.\
You get a free course on getting design approval.\
A free course on building a user centric culture. 

So you can see, how he's outlining what it is you'll get.

***A bit of manipulation:***\
One thing you might wanna consider doing is allowing people to actually purchase the report, if they don't want to sign up to your email list.\
Now, nobody will ever do that because why would you? if you can get it for free from signing up for an email list?

But it means you could put monetary value on the report, which makes the report look more valuable, when you then get it for free. 

consider making it free for a limited period, because that motivates people to sign up now and rather than later.

And one of the really important things about your call to action is,\
make sure you handle any objections that people may have.

So for example, people obviously are nervous about giving over their email address.\
So you wanna make it clear that you're not gonna sell it them.\
You wanna make it clear that they can unsubscribe in one click.

And that you're never gonna share their email address with anybody. So you're really kind of reassuring them in the moment.

## Crafting an email course

- one email for each topic
- scheduled weekly
- about 500 words each, basic formatting

the way that the course will work is it's basically what's called a trigger-based campaign.

So if somebody signs up today, they will get lesson one tomorrow, lesson two the day after, lesson three the day after. 

And if someone doesn't sign up for four days, they'll still get one, two, three, four, and those kinds of order.

So, that means that everyone is going through the same initial introduction, no matter when they join.

In terms of how you create your course, very simple, one email for each of the topics in your report

So we went six to eight topics, didn't we?\
And then you schedule those to go out once a week. So once somebody is subscribed, they get one a week. to begin with, you're really building that relationship in those early days.

So once a week, they get an email from the course. They only need to be about 500 words each. Don't need to be very long. They only need basic formatting to aid a bit scan ability. 

that's all there is to the structure of the course. When they finish the course, then they just get your monthly email or your biweekly email.

***Writing each email***\
Recap\
briefly the challenge or piece of advice from the report that you're gonna focus on in that email.

Advice\
You're gonna give a little bit of advice, provide a few practical tips about how to address that challenge, or take them closer to that best practice.

Engage\
And then you're gonna encourage them to contact you if they're struggling or if they've got any questions\
so we're beginning to encourage that contact.

***Dont hold back***\
at this point, with any of this, with the report, with the emails, the whole thing, don't ever hold back.

Share all the advice that you have freely. Don't worry about people doing it for themselves and not hiring you. People are still gonna reach out to you because they don't have the time or they feel too intimidated by the topic to try it themselves. 

Don't worry about your competition reading it and copying you.

You're always gonna be a step ahead. People are gonna hire you because they know and like you, not because somebody copied what you did.

***Still don't sell***\
And the other thing is still do not sell. You don't need to sell in those emails, right? There's no need to promote your services actively.\
Be open about what you do & even recommend that they should hire "somebody", but dont push yourself.

***Automate***\
Even though people will enroll on your mailing list at different times, we still want everybody to pass through the same course before proceeding to your regular monthly emails.

To achieve this, we will need to use a tool like ==Convertkit== that will add users to your email course, when they subscribe and then tag them when they have completed it. so you can start sending them regular emails.



> [!info] So to recap

> Then over the next few weeks, they get those emails courses, and then they go onto the normal mailing list.

## people that took part in the survey

those people that participated in the survey, we're gonna drop them one last email. And it's gonna make it clear that the email is about the report and showing our appreciation. 

So our title is gonna be, Your promised report, with a big thank you. And then it's gonna say how much you appreciated them being involved in it and how they'd managed to help turn it into something bigger.

![[Pasted image 20240820234326.png]]
You're then gonna tell them what the report ended up covering, thanks to their feedback and involvement.\
You're then gonna actually attach the report to the email, right, as a PDF file, so people can help themselves.\
Also, if you did do the review, the audit of their site, attach their scores to it as well so they can see their individual scores.

And then you wanna just introduce this idea of the email series, what the email series is gonna cover.\
Finally, you say, if that email course sounds good, you can subscribe for free here. So you're not requiring that group to subscribe to get the report, because that group contributed to the survey, right?

So you promised you'd give it to them, you're giving it to them, right? You're hoping they will also sign up to the email course as well, but there's no guarantee. For everybody else, if they want the report, they have to sign up for the email course


## People who didn't complete the survey

send a variation to those who did not complete the survey. They will only get the report if they also sign up for ongoing communication.

![[Pasted image 20240821103101.png]]

## Reach influencer

***The trouble with influencers***

They get dozens of emails every week, pitching something to them.

And with so much noise, **a single email is not gonna get their attention.**\
Now as we've sent them a couple of emails, we have warmed them up a little bit.


if you wanna start building a relationship with these people and you want them to be promoting the report and that kind of thing.\
You're gonna need to engage with them a little bit better than that. You have to build a relationship with them.


***How to engage influencers***

**The best way of doing that is to be helpful.**
- follow them on social media, pay attention to what they're talking about, contribute to those conversations. 
- Providing with help where you can, be encouraging and grateful
- amplifying their content for them and re-sharing it, that kind of thing. 
- Only contact them directly, if they have responded to you a few times.
- And don't just immediately email them, but over social media just ask them, is it all right if I drop you an email?

So nurture that relationship first, rather than just going in with a cold email.

![[Pasted image 20240821112527.png]]

And when you are emailing influencers, basically, the key there is to really go in and thank them for all that they've shared online. Be very honest about that you'd like their help, tell them that you wanna share stuff, but only after you've kind of established that relationship. 

Now if you get lucky earlier on in the process when you reach out to them previously, you might have either got an influencer who is willing to put their name on this and do this with you.

In which case that changes the ballgame entirely, because you can use their name and reputation to promote the report. Or alternatively, they might have been willing to be interviewed for the report, in which case make sure you mentioned them in the report.\
And now you can go back and say,\
hey, thanks so much for that interview, I've included you in the report, here's a free copy of it, right?.

***emailing influencing publications***

![[Pasted image 20240821112920.png]]

it's basically talking about what the report is, whether they'd share it with their audience, etc.


>[!question]- a separate domain, or removing all of the navigation on the rest of your site, or a landing pitch?  
>you can probably stick with your same domain, But if you can just create subdomain, would seem logical.
>
>remove all the navigation to the rest of the site. So that you're not overly pushing your services and things alongside that.

you're gonna give you a link to get the slide deck.

you're also gonna ask them to sign up to your newsletter. So when you go to that page, you're gonna see for yourself that is not part of the main blog world sites on a subdomain. But there's no navigation, there's no mention of your services or anything like that there.

So that's the kind of thing you're aiming at.


## Re-posting Content

the best coders are lazy coders, cuz they reuse their code, you will exactly do the same with content.

We are gonna now squeeze that content till every drop has come out of it and we've got every piece of value\
Because, let's be honest, we're not gonna wanna be recreating this amount of content on a regular basis.

we're gonna start to use some more traditional techniques of content marketing to reach many more people, we want to reach.

**Reuse your content and use it to attract attention**

`Email & report -> blog posts, webinar & social media`

just saying the same thing in slightly different ways in slightly different mediums. So that is exactly what you guys are gonna do now. You're not gonna have to constantly come up with new stuff.

We're just gonna take those things, and we're gonna repurpose them.

So for example,\
***we're gonna turn our report into posts***\
So ideally, we wanna take our content & turn them into guest posts on other people's sites\
So all those influencers we were reaching out to, all those publications, we're gonna say, "hey, we've got this amazing report."

However failing that, we can post them on our website but optimized for search keywords using a tool like kwfinder.com.

Which allows you to research into different questions, maybe, that people ask. And we'll then create keyword-optimized blog posts designed to rank well on those different keywords.

So these guest posts based on a report are really easy to create. You decide on a question that you answered in your report, and you use that question as the basis of your content.

include a clear call to action in the post to signup for the report and email course.

we are creating articles specifically for our target audience. We're trying to get them shown or published on blogs where we know our audience are reading.

And we're having a clear call to action at the end of it to try and encourage them to give us their email address, so that we can keep in contact with them. And that is the underlying principle

If there's not a value that's coming out of it, there's no point of doing it, right?\
if you're speaking at a conference for free, or going to a local meetup, or doing any of these stuff, and you don't try and capture someone's email, there's very little value in it compared to this.

it's certainly worth considering, face to face interaction, (personality, humor, accent, your audience gets to know you better etc) can influence your decision of whether to hire someone or not.

Webinar is a good way for doing this.
- aim for 40min & lots of time for questions
- cover 3 key findings from your report & your thoughts
- add the webinar to your landing page for the report.
- consider approaching meetups & conferences with the talk.

## Promoting your course with social media

you can take the material from your report and your email course, pull out snippets, turn them into pictures and put them on Instagram, turn them into text and put them on Twitter.

***creating social media updates from your content***\
content people like to share:
- statistics, to make people appear clever.
- quotes, that people can agree with\
	You've got great quotes from people within the industry\
	Because, hopefully you've spoken to a few people by this stage, put that in the report.\
	And now you can quote that on social media. And of course, if people were mentioned on social media, what do they do? They reshare it, they retweet it, so that spreads it further.
- practical actions & advice to make people look helpful.

Format to use:\
- video & audio from your webinar.
- quotes from your report shown as images using canva.
- include links to your landing page. (*must*)
- include relevant hashtags
- include influencers where relevant.

Automating your social media with tools like coschedule.
