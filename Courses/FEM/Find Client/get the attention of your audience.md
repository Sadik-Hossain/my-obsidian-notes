Once you have chosen your audience, you need to get their attention.\
This section will show you how to maximize the limited time you have to do just that.

## How to Plan an effective attention strategy

**we will not be selling**\
people can smell spam a mile away. The minute it becomes anything other than, an honest sincere interests on,
- who they are
- what they do
- how their job works
- challenges that they faces on a daily basis.
and turns into a sales thing, forget it, it blows off.

Also, even if you did write them a sales email, the chance of contacting them at the exact moment whether they're willing to buy are pretty unlikely.

**However, we will...**
- Ask for their help.\
	spam wants you to buy something or do something, spam does not seek your opinion or want to hear from you.\
	Instead, we will ask people to share their experiences & wisdom. That makes **people feel valued and listened to.**
- Provide value in return\
	in return for them sharing their experiences, we are going to provide them with insights into their sectors & job, a lightweight review of their websites & ongoing advice and support.


## The Deliverables

What are we going to sending/providing them.


**A report**\
In return for signing up for our emails, we will provide an industry report that gives them insights into how their sector is using digital. Challenges it face, some advice & best practice on that.

**A short site review**\
we will also offer a short first impression (ui/ux, accessibility, analytics, web perf, stuff that can be seen from frontend) in return for their participation, in providing information that will go into the report.

we will say them the following,
```
thank you so much for giving us a lil bit of your time to share your experience with us. 
In return for that, if you want us to do, quick first impression review for your website. In return for your participation, then we would happily do that, as a thank you.
```
we are giving value.

**Regular emails**\
we will provide ongoing value & keep people engaged by sending them regular advice via email that helps them overcome the challenges they face in their role.
