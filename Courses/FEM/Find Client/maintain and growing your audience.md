## Planning your regular mailing

over time you may decide to target multiple sectors. 

So you might initially have done like no charities and whatever. And you went through and you did the report and the survey and everything, and you got that up and running, you got an email course for that up and running.

And then you decide you wanna target higher education. And that doesn't mean that you get rid of the charities one. you've got some people that will be still coming in via that route

and now you're gonna basically copy and paste for a different sector. Now you probably can keep a lot of the report, a lot of the emails, a lot of everything, and reuse it for a different sector with some changes.

But what this ultimately means is you've got some people coming in from one sector and some people coming in from another. 

They're going through two separate email courses, and then they're merging into one overall list. So, what that effectively means is that our regular emails that go out are gonna have to be not as sector specific.

Unless we want to tag users which we can do, based on which sector they've come from, which campaign they've come from, and then do separately tailored emails for each audience. Now in most cases that's an overkill.


Now, there are occasionally, you can write a topic where you wanna say slightly different things to different audiences, and that's fine, you can do that.

But most of the time, keep the work level manageable and not have to write double or triple the number of emails in any one particular week. So don't worry about overly worried about that, think more about writing generic emails.

## How your digital channels fit together

you've got different channels that you will be using. You've got email, you've got your blog probably and you've got social.

if you get those right then they reinforce one another, and don't involve a lot of extra work the whole time.\
So, let's look at the role of each.

***Social***\
the role of social is to grab people's attention and encourage them to share your content and to drive traffic to a blog post on a related subject.

***blog***\
Your blog has two roles.\
First is to attract traffic through SEO-targeted posts. if you can't write guest posts for other people, you can write posts on your own site that are targeted with their SEO.\
second, it should take any visitors from either search engine or social and drive people to your landing page.

***email***\
email will keep them front of mind, slowly building your credibility until they're ready to buy. 


> [!tip] social grabs attention, blog is a kind of intermedia to drive them to the landing page, that gets them on to email.


you repurpose and reiterate.

from that one email, a blog post, social media updates, video and podcast\
All that from one single email.\
And that's what you're looking to do, to reach people in whatever channel they're using with the same content.


## what to include in email

***Personal***\
These emails mustn't read like a marketing material. They need to be as if you were talking to someone. Make it personal, friendly & informal.

***Helpful***\
every email should provide value to the reader, that could be in form of advice\
but it might also empathy over their challenges.

***Dont sell***\
you cant mention your service, but dont sell them.\
for ex: its okay to say, as I was preparing for my upcoming workshop on finding clients.

Because, effectively the knowledge and expertise that you are sharing will be you're selling.\
That's how you demonstrate your expertise and knowledge.

## Common mistakes to avoid

***Inconsistency***\
decide on a release schedule and then stick to it. The same time, the same day, every single time. Set aside time to work on these emails. They matter as much as your client work does.

***infrequent***\
Readers cannot be allowed to forget about you, if you only email them a couple of times a year they'll forget you exist. paul's recommendation at least once a month.

***Promotional***\
don't sell. Your advice is gonna establish your expertise and the topics you write about will show your readers the kind of services you offer.\
ex:\
You don't need to say, you provide conversion rate optimization services, you just need to talk about conversion rate optimization.


## How to come with email topics

it's about just building up an ongoing list of topics.

And a lot of that is just about you're surrounded by ideas all the time.\
You just need to pay attention and write it down.

so that when you sit down to write an email, you've already got ideas there.

- *pay attention to the conversations you're having with clients*\
	They'll ask you questions. That's an email!\
	You'll get stuck on a project and frustrated on a project. That's an email!
- *Keep an eye out for subjects being discussed on the influencer sites, the sites that your audience are hanging out at*
	Those are all potential emails. Every question that's asked on a forum\
	every search that's done on Google related to a particular subject\
	every mention on social media, Those are all email topics.\
- *consider the work you're doing*\
	Think about the work you're doing at that particular time. That's all content.\

for ex:\
I've been working at the moment on doing usability testing. That's a subject. And I had a particularly bad experience recently where I did usability testing\
we were benchmarking my version against the existing version and my version performed worse than the existing version.
 
actually write an email about that,\
`how to deal with when your usability test fails.`\
That's a good subject.

people wrote to Paul, afterwards going, I'm so glad it's not just me. Or I really appreciated your honesty there. It's great.

**write around services you offer**

>[!tip] Don't say this is a list of the services I offer, but write about topics relating to those services.
>Write about services you offer, not directly, but write around those services. 

**Talk about the value of what you want to offer**\
if you're working on usability testing, talk about the value of usability testing.

**pay attention to what annoys you**\
write about things that annoys you.

**keep an eye out for good examples.**
You live in a world full of examples, you're interacting with it every day.\
So me as a user experience person, every app I use, every website I visit, they're all potential good examples that I can refer to.\
If you work in performance, then you're gonna see good and bad examples of well performing or poorly performing sites.

**Research what others googling**\
And if all else fails, research what people are Googling. If you type in user experience or performance and see what comes up afterwards.

if you're struggling with topics then pick any particular topic & approach it in many different ways.

--- end-multi-column

Avoid starting with a blank page

start keeping a list of possible ideas in notion or obsidian.

Every time you have an idea, add it to the list along with a few bullets to help you get started.

Once in a while, sit down & brainstorm a load of ideas to keep your list topped up.

>[!tldr] sometime, it can be something's popped into head and you wanna write about it straight away.
Something has particularly hit you, and so you wanna write an email about it then and there.

So actually, although you've got these backlog of ideas, you can only use those if you really get stuck.


> [!tip] Don't be afraid to express opinion
> a lot of people are afraid of expressing their opinions, because someone will tell them they're wrong, which is totally understandable.
> you don't need to be afraid of that because, people will tell you you're wrong, even if you say nothing.

general advice is, stick to talking about your personal experience because nobody can say that that was wrong. That was what happened to you in your situation.

Or you can focus on quoting other people. Borrow authority. someone says this, I noticed this. someone's idea, opinion, advice.

it's okay to recognize not everybody's gonna agree or like what you say, and that's all right.\
Also you don't need everybody to like you just need enough people to keep you in business.


## Find Your Voice

>[!success] personality is how we win business at the end of the day

More so than your skills, more so than anything else.

Paul is a good user experience designer, but not the best by any stretch of the imagination. There are many more well qualified people to teach user experience design than him, but they don't.

And that's because, although they're very good at what they do, **they don't market themselves**

they don't have the personality to come out and do this kind of thing.\
So, what we are getting at is, we're not hired just on our ability, we're hired on lots of different factors, personality is a big part of that.

When we write online, we've got this impression that we have to be professional. And  have to write in this certain way and it makes us so dull.


that's detrimental at the end of the day. because, you can only be who you are, and if we try and strip out our personality, it just leads to dull and unengaging content.

>[!danger] Your personality is the one thing that your competitors can't replicate.
>

Not everyone will like you, that's fine. There are a lot of people that strongly dislike me. But enough people will like you to sustain your business and that's what ultimately matters.

>[!quote] And if people do like you, then they'll listen to you, and if they listen to you, they'll come to trust you, and if they come to trust you, they'll buy from you.

So personality really is a very powerful tool for winning work and we need to stop trying to put on a face of professionalism in everything we do. 

at the end of the day they're all human beings, they all laugh, they'll joke\
they will make mistakes in work, they're just like anybody else, and so you need to connect with them just like anybody else.

You don't treat them like some kind of corporate bot that you have to program in a certain way with the words you use. 

Effectively, I think it boils down to this,\
**be more of what you already are**

you cant be anybody else, don't try.

Instead, just exaggerate a little bit of who you are, to make it more obvious.

for example, I'm enthusiastic and passionate, I get excited and I might want to be, and so I'm more of that. 


But it is naturally in my personality, it comes out more when I do stuff like this. When I write, I'm more flippant than I would be normally. I'm a little bit more of what I am.

now perhaps you are someone who is really considered and thoughtful, that's fine, then amp that up, be really considered and thoughtful, right?

No personality type is wrong when it comes to this stuff. You just got to be a little bit more than you are. 

>[!tip] You don't need to appeal to everyone
> the Internet is a big place. And there are a lot of potential clients out there and someone is going to love who you are.

have opinions, don't just recycle the thoughts of others.

I know it's kind of scary expressing your opinions, but it's really worthwhile and people want to know your perspective.

And a lot of us go, we look around and we look at other people in our industry. We go yeah, they really know their stuff, all right? I could never be as good a communicator as then.

No, you couldn't be the same as them.\
but actually your way of explaining things, your way of talking about things, will appeal to a different group.

Some people, for example,\
Jeremy Keith, Paul just love the way he talks. But for a lot of people, he's too intellectual, he's very theoretical. for some people, his msg kind of goes over their heads, and he's not for people like that.

And so maybe your voice is more appealing for people like that.

So basically, you have got your place in all of this, you have got your market, you've got your space. And its encouraged to express your own opinions.

**write yourself a bit of a personal manifesto**
- What is it you care about?\
	So for paul, it's accessibility. He believes the web should be for everybody. That's one of his fundamental principles that he believes. 
- What are your big passion?
- What really annoys you?
- what don't you believe in?
- what do you believe in?
- what you stand for?
- what don't you like?
- what do you care about?

it is worth thinking about who you are, how you're gonna present yourself and how you're gonna communicate as you begin to build your list and give yourself a little bit confidence.

Don't strive for perfection. when you start, you'll be rubbish. And its ok to suck. Perfection requires a payment, and that is to suck at first.

## Growing your list

**your subscribers are the best way to grow your reach.**

You wanna encourage your subscribers to recommend your list to others and to feel able to recommend your services despite them not having personally worked with you.

normal word of mouth comes from,\
I've worked with this guy he's really good.

Most of Paul's word of mouth recommendations come from,\
here's a guy I've followed for ages, he's really good.
Most of them haven't even worked with Paul, but they still recommend me to other people.

so anything you can do to encourage your users to start spreading the word about you, you should absolutely do.

## How do you turn your users & readers into advocates?

- [[#^99ace3|connect with them]]
- [[#^79cce0|show appreciation]]
- [[#^2a7f91|encourage referrals]]

>[!tip] ***connect with them.***
> - ask questions
> - run surveys
> - start debates
> - ask for help
> - do meetups
> - get them connect to one another

^99ace3

Take opportunities to actually talk with them.\
you can ask them questions and get them to reply to you.

You can run surveys in your emails from time to time, you could start debates.\
Paul pick controversial subjects and let people argue it out with one another in a in a safe environment.\
Paul got Slack channel where he does that, and he's the arbiter that says, "no, you've gone too far there."

***Ask for help***\
that's one of the best ways of getting your audience to engage with you is by going, I'm stuck on something, can anyone help me?

It's amazing, cuz people love the idea that after they've been getting advice from you for ages, suddenly they can help you.

***do meetups***\
If you can't do a in person meet up, but just start up a Zoom call every two weeks.

In fact, on a Friday afternoon,\
Paul would open a Zoom call & invite people from mailing list, Slack  and Twitter to **Come and hang out together**, we've **got to know each other** and it was great, just spent a bit time together, and **get them connecting with each other as well.**

having a Slack channel/discord is great, where they can talk to one another, 


> [!example]
> Imagine We're sitting in the pub together, and we're chatting and getting to know one another and I turn around and I say, I collect paper clips, you might get mercilessly teased for that.
> 
> I mean, who collects paperclips, right? And so I'm then gonna get a bit shy and a bit embarrassed that I clicked paper clips and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
> 
> Now imagine the same scenario, but when I say I collect paper clips, Mark goes, no way, so do I !!
> and then we start infusing together about how cool it is to collect paper clips.
>
> Now that's changed the dynamic all of a sudden, we're reinforcing one another, and you too was sitting there going, well perhaps paper clips are cool? I don't know, am I missing something in here?
> 
> And that's what happens when you connect your followers to one another, they start reinforcing each other going, I like Paul's work too, yeah, I find him inspiring. Fact that everybody finds me inspiring just makes me giggle but I do get emails like that
> 
> they reinforce one another and it's great. So connecting users to one another, you building their relationship is really important,

>[!tip] **Show appreciation**
> - show appreciation
> - do giveaways
> - do random acts of kindness
> - ask how you can do better

***show appreciation***\
to those people that follow you. thank people all the time. ^79cce0

***do giveaways***\
if ever get offered free stuff, you'll get a lot of people write to you and go, "we want you to try out this cool new app or whatever."\
which will happen as you get a bit of an audience, and these days, I say, no, but I'll give it away to somebody else.

It's great, free stuff for people there on my mail list, why not? 

***random acts of kindness***
so if you got a bit of spare time, drop out one of your mails also emails. & say, I've got bits free time, anybody need any help with anything free a charge, maybe a zoom call on problem solving etc.

***ask how you can do better***\
if you can spare just a few minutes to do this, Why not help them out? It's a nice thing to do, and then just asking people how you can do better?

What do they want help with?\
What are they struggling with?\
How can you be there for them?



>[!tip] **Encourage referrals**
> - make newsletter sharing easy.
> - offer commission
> - give them something in return
> - ask politely
> - Ask why they dont

^2a7f91


***ask for referral, make sharing easy***\
then you can start encouraging referrals cuz you kind of built a bit of social credit with them.\
So you make your newsletter easy for sharing for start, so, that's why all of my newsletter emails, also make available as blog posts so that people can easily share them with other people.

***Offer commission & give something in return***\
You can do things or offer commission and stuff, give commissions if they refer people. offer them something in return, maybe, just ask politely, can you help me out, I'm really trying to grow the list.

***Ask Politely***\
Paul wrote an email with honesty & personality that said,\
I'm coming up to the end of the month and I really wanna buy myself a new camera.

But my wife has told me I'm not allowed it, unless I get over our agreed target by the value of the camera, Anybody willing to hire me for 800 pounds so I could meet the target?

and people did, they contacted him and said, I'll take a couple of hours or an hour's worth of consultancy.

Just from being honest and asking nicely and with humanity rather than being some sales bot.

***Ask why they don't***\
And you can occasionally, and you got to word this in the right way, but you can ask people\
well, why don't you recommend me?\
Am I doing something wrong?\
Is there something, I could be doing better? 

## Other ways to grow your list

>[!tip] ***Other ways to grow your list***
> - SEO orientated blogging
> - webinars
> - podcast guest
> - more cold emailing
> - social media
> - community engagement
> - LinkedIn or google ads
> - guest post
> - a new sector

You can do search engine optimized blog posts\
you do the webinars\
you can do speaking podcast guests that's a really good one. There's loads of podcasts, they're constantly looking for guests, you've got something good to talk about, why not?

You could do more cold emailing\
you could reach out to people individually, don't do bulk emails, don't buy a list or anything stupid like that. But if there are a few people you encounter that you really would like to connect with, that's okay.

social media, community engagement,\
getting involved in things like higher education mailing list, comments, community forum, server etc.


LinkedIn or Google Ads\
Now they're a little bit more worthwhile considering because you've got a call to action that isn't just by me, it's signed up for my mailing list, so you can nurture that relationship, promote the report, etc.

you can try a different sector and repeat the whole process.

And then finally you can do the going generic approach

a lot of Paul's growth now actually just comes from people stumbling across through various means and not through a specific campaign. as he's now at the stage, where he's built his profile enough.

when it comes to growing your list, don't abandon a sector too soon.

> [!tip] Monitor what works
> a lot of people kind of giving up before just before they're about to make it, and it's frustrating to watch, and really it comes down to **monitoring what works and what doesn't**.


***pay attention***\
look, how many did the finding clients, course, lead people to sign up for my mailing list? 

maybe that wasn't as successful as the design processes course, then you probably focus on that one a little bit more.

Or, hey front end masters is a really good way of reaching people with a that leads to a lot of people signing up for my mailing list.\
see if I can persuade him to let me do another course, things like that so really pay attention to what works and what doesn't.

So you're not wasting your time on channels that, don't really take you anywhere.


## Making your list appropriate to a wider audience

remember that ongoing Emails.\
That you're sending out every two weeks needs to be appropriate to a broader audience than just your initial group that you targeted, so you're gonna need to segment your audience.


**How to segment your audience**
- ***have separate forms***\
	you will prolly want separate landing pages if you are targeting different sectors, That means you can tag people depending on which form they used.\
	and so each one is gonna have its own different landing page and you can tag people based on which landing pages you know which sector they're from.

- ***Ask them***\
	you can just ask people. have a drop down list that says, do you work in house? Do you work as part of an agency or are you a freelancer?
	add additional fields ask for more info when they signup or send them a survey later. you can tag them based on their responses.

- ***watch them***\
	you can tag people based on their behavior.\
	For ex: what web pages they look at, whether they come from, what link they click in your email.
	know what they've clicked on, for example in an email. So what I can do is based on what they click on, I will tag them with different subjects.

>[!tldr] tend to customize your content a little bit around those different audiences. 
>
So if they're always looking at design content, then I tagged them as probably being designers and they might get some customized content more specific to them. 

**How to customize based on segmentation**
- ***different boarding***\
	you have email course for first sector, other sectors have a variation of this onboarding course. Alternatively, you can create a generic onboarding series **based on the issues relating to the services you offer.**
	
	So for example, that the email course that somebody from charities receives will be different from the email course, that somebody from higher education receives. 

- ***Email variations***\
	once people are beyond the onboarding series, we will want all segments to join a single list (to save us work). However we can tailor our emails based on the segments, that can either be separate emails or just different wording.
	
	vary emails every once in a while as well, so basically that the emails might get tailored based on their different interests or segmentations.
	
	ex: if you know a designer then write this, if it's anyone else they get this. 


## take your marketing to the next level

- ***Get organized***\
	dedicate regular time to marketing and get better at tracking what works and what doesn't. Experiment & monitor the results\
	Start using A/B testing, an experiment to monitor the results and things like that, in terms of dedicated time.

> [!tip] more time on marketing > more attraction > charge higher > only work with higher paying client > more time for marketing
> the more time you spend marketing, the more people you attract,
the higher your rates you can charge.
>
>Because, you only need to convert a small percentage of them, which means **the higher your rates are, the less hours you have to do with chargeable clients.**
>
> Which allows more time for marketing and you go round and round in circles 

- ***Be ambitious***\
	work on bigger projects.\
	eventually, if you can churn out a few of these reports and you're feeling more confident in your writing, you might wanna write a books video courses or workshops.

	these are really good at raising your profile, because they've got higher barrier to entry. They're harder to do, fewer people do them, therefore they're considered more valuable.

- ***Price higher***\
	As you see more work, don't necessarily just start hiring more people, which is what everybody instinctively wants to do.

	Instead raise your prices instead, that allows more time for marketing and leads to that virtuous cycle I was talking about.
