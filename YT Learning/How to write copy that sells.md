Write landing pages that evokes desire. 

how would you go about selling T-shirts or clothing or stuff that
doesn't solve a problem?

## principles for desire

1. **discover the essence of your product**

so the essence is the unique trait that is desirable about your product.

all products have something different about them and something that is the most desirable part of them and that's what you're trying to find.

you're trying to find the essence, the spirit of the product.\
the way that we do that is we use it, we touch it, we smell it, we feel
it, we wear it, we do whatever we can with it.

you're trying to find out what you love most about it and it might be small, it might be a detail, it's experiential all the time.

you want to set up your phone,\
tap the voice memo get yourself recording and then use the product.\
go through it, touch it, feel it, smell it and speak to the microphone
about everything you're experiencing.

all of those little details and then when you listen to it back or you read the transcription back.\
one of those points is going to jump out at you, if it's not already obvious and that's going to be the essence and that Essence is important.

2. **Focus on an angle**

we're going to get away from the product and now we're going to focus on your consumer, your audience, your people and now what you want to do is you want to focus on an angle.

an angle is either a problem/solution, it's a dream outcome or
it's like a unique selling proposition, a benefit.

a really great way to come up with a unique angle, is to go specific.

so, speak to a specific person about a specific problem, that's the best way to find a really hard-hitting relevant angle.

>**Elegance is the opposite of extravagance**

avoid fluffy
adjectives avoid trying to create Desire
by saying things like marvelous and
spectacular and it's just going to make
you sound like a pompous that
is trying really hard to get someone to
buy something and when that happens
you're making people feel like they
don't trust you
