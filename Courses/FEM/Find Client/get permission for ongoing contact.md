## why ongoing communication matters 

Our survey and report may have got us on our audience's radar, but we need to stay there and continue to build credibility in the minds of our audience.

We need to be able to show them how great we are, okay? Then you can tell somebody, yeah, I'm an amazing developer, I do all this great work or whatever. But that is not as valuable as them discovering that from sales based on what they've learned about you, what they've heard about you, what they've read, that you've said, those kinds of things.

>[!tip] stay front and center in people's minds 
>it's essential, that we stay front and center in people's minds\
>so that, when they need our services, we're instantly their preferred supplier.

So it's those two things that we need to stay front and center in the minds, **we need to build credibility**. And that's where regular contact via email can provide that.

That's why on my website, at the bottom of every single page, you've got a call to action to sign up to my mailing list, cuz once I've got you on my mailing list, I've gotcha. That's it, you are at my mercy. 

**how do we gain the permission that we need?**

***Promote the report***\
the number one thing that we wanna do is we wanna promote the report.\
So we're gonna contact our audience and tell them about the report. And we're also gonna reach out to those influencers

***provide an email course***\
In addition to that, alongside the report, we probably want to offer a short email course that dives a little bit deeper into the issues that are found in the report. \
Its not extra work. It's regurgitating what's in the report and adding a bit more detail.

so you've downloaded the report. Now, you get these kind of series of introductory emails. And then once you've had that emails, then you're going on to that ongoing advice.

***Provide ongoing advice***\
So after people finish the course, they will continue to hear from you via monthly emails forever or bi-weekly or whatever you decide to do.

So really, the report is done, that's your upfront work, piece of work done. Then we're gonna put together a short email course that only ever needs to be done once.

And then when people sign up, they're gonna get those over a series of weeks. So once you've done all of that, then really, your kind of week to week marketing is literally just doing those ongoing newsletters.


## Designing a landing page that encourages permission

**Landing page objectives**
- Establish your credibility.\
	why do I want emails from this person?\
	Why do I care about what they do?
- create a desire for the course & report
	show people why that is worth having
- Encourage signups

At this stage, it is not about selling your services.\
This is not the place to promote yourself, which means that we probably don't want to make this a part of our existing website

the minute you integrate it alongside your services and the stuff you're selling, it's suddenly all feels a lot more salesy.

And I wanna focus it just on your giving away free advice. So you probably don't wanna do it.\
But you can reuse the design, if you want to, that's not a problem.

## Landing page content
So, what needs to go on this landing page?

***About***\
Outline the main topics of the report & email course and a couple of the key findings.
You provide an outline of the main topics, the report covers, and what the email course will cover.\
And you maybe share a couple of key findings to get people interested.

ex:\
The three highest ranking sites based on our criteria were, find out how you ranked that kind of thing.

***Benefits***
- instant access to the report
- actionable advice for improving your site
- awareness of the competitive landscape
- evidence to support your requests to management.
- Insights into areas of innovation,


***Credibility***\
Write a couple of short sentences about your credibility and the various sources that contributed to the report.\
then create a compelling call to action. So this is the call to action that goes on my own website.

## what does a good call to action need to have on your landing page?

- be clear on what people will get
- consider charging for non-subscribers
- consider making it free for a limited period
- tackle any objections people may have

It needs to be clear about what people are gonna get.

So in Paul's case,\
his generic mailing list is: Improve Your Knowledge of User Experience Design, Digital Marketing and Digital Leadership.\
And then it says,\
you're gonna get emails every one to two weeks.\
You get a free course on getting design approval.\
A free course on building a user centric culture. 

So you can see, how he's outlining what it is you'll get.

***A bit of manipulation:***\
One thing you might wanna consider doing is allowing people to actually purchase the report, if they don't want to sign up to your email list.\
Now, nobody will ever do that because why would you? if you can get it for free from signing up for an email list?

But it means you could put monetary value on the report, which makes the report look more valuable, when you then get it for free. 

consider making it free for a limited period, because that motivates people to sign up now and rather than later.

And one of the really important things about your call to action is,\
make sure you handle any objections that people may have.

So for example, people obviously are nervous about giving over their email address.\
So you wanna make it clear that you're not gonna sell it them.\
You wanna make it clear that they can unsubscribe in one click.

And that you're never gonna share their email address with anybody. So you're really kind of reassuring them in the moment.

## Crafting an email course

the way that the course will work is it's basically what's called a trigger-based campaign.

So if somebody signs up today, they will get lesson one tomorrow, lesson two the day after, lesson three the day after. 

And if someone doesn't sign up for four days, they'll still get one, two, three, four, and those kinds of order.

So, that means that everyone is going through the same initial introduction, no matter when they join.

In terms of how you create your course, very simple, one email for each of the topics in your report

So we went six to eight topics, didn't we?\
And then you schedule those to go out once a week. So once somebody is subscribed, they get one a week. to begin with, you're really building that relationship in those early days.

So once a week, they get an email from the course. They only need to be about 500 words each. Don't need to be very long. They only need basic formatting to aid a bit scan ability. And that's it, that's all there is to the structure of the course. When they finish the course, then they just get your monthly email or your biweekly email.

[00:02:41]  
Writing each email, right? Basically, it's really easy. You create a recap of what was said in the report, right? Recap briefly the challenge or piece of advice from the report that you're gonna focus on in that email. You're gonna give a little bit of advice, provide a few practical tips about how to address that challenge, or take them closer to that best practice.

[00:03:06]  
And then you're gonna encourage them to contact you if they're struggling or if they've got any questions, so we're beginning to encourage that contact. That's it, right? Really nice and simple. A side I wanna say at this point is with any of this, with the report, with the emails, the whole thing, don't ever hold back.

[00:03:26]  
Share all the advice that you have freely. Don't worry about people doing it for themselves and not hiring you. People are still gonna reach out to you because they don't have the time or they feel too intimidated by the topic to try it themselves. Don't worry about your competition reading it and copying you, right?

[00:03:45]  
You're always gonna be a step ahead. People are gonna hire you because they know and like you, not because somebody copied what you did, right? And the other thing is still do not sell. You don't need to sell in those emails, right? There's no need to promote your services actively.

[00:04:05]  
Be open about what you do
