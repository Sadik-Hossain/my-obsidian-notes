## Content Strategy

The 5 step framework:
- **Create on one platform**\
	Keep it simple, don't overwhelm
- **for one person**
- **About one problem**
- **Systems / once a day**
- **Consistency/ repetition**

### Create for one person

instead of picking a niche, you wanna pick a person.

if you pick a niche, lets say: web design, and you post how to, tips & tricks\
you will attract other web designers rather than your ideal client.

your contents should focus on the specific person, that you want to attract. Your ideal client.

for ex:\
when anna's ideal clients are,

2-3 years into their business, most of them already had a websiteÂ that they had built themselves and was just doing okay.

but there were struggling to effectively communicate their offer and unable to attract the right type of clients.

if she was just making, how to build a website content with generic web design tips.

that would be only attracting other web designers or these business owners at the beginning stages of their Journey\
who are trying to DIY their own website. because, they don't have the money to invest in a web designer, just yet.

so the content that needs to be created, has to keep that specific client in mind and talking directly to them, and the problems that they're
facing.

the goal of your content have to show them the missing piece, that you could help them with.

what's missing from their website, that are stopping them attracting those higher budget clients or making sales?

so, she focuses a lot on sales psychology & the copywriting aspect that most of these people were missing and also doing website audits.

that points out, what people could do to increase conversions & attract the right type of customers.

when you get more specific, maybe you get less views\
because, they don't appeal to as many people. 

but instead your content is going to act like a magnet to the person who is interested in this topic, your ideal client.

so it's going to be much more effective in searching out these people who are actually interested to work with you.

you want to pick a specific person,\
where are they now?\
where do they want to be?

you want to obsess over,\
their struggles\
their insecurities\
their goals and Ambitions

imagine that person is your friend sat in front of you\
and give them everything you know that's going to help them get to where they want to be.

don't hold anything back\
be honest and upfront as you would with your best friend\
your rooting for this person\
you really want them to succeed.

this is the type of energy that we're looking for in your content. because the person on the other end seeing this, is going to feel that.

we're at the stage, where there is so much content out there, everyone is just churning out the same copy paste content\
going to chat GPT asking them to spit out a list of content ideas and then putting some text over a 7-second video and thinking that's all they need to do.

this is why it's so difficult to build trust with your audience.

if you approach your content with bare minimum energy, then you're going to see bare minimum results.

to stand out and really connect with people in a sea of content creators, you need to make content with some real depth to it.


> [!tip] 
> you want people to be able to take your content and really apply this to see results, this is how you build trust and Authority.\
It shows, that you are the expert and you know what you're talking about and you know how to help them.


### Overcome Imposter Syndrome

the final barrier that a lot of you need to overcome is,\
how do you go about sharing your expertise, if you haven't had many clients or experience?

because, for a lot of you will feel like an impostor to speak on something, that you don't have proof or experience about.

so how do you overcame this impostor syndrome?

whenever, you don't feel confident about something, the best way to overcome this is to be over prepared.

do all the research, learn everything you possibly can and become an expert in this topic 

if you want to be seen as an expert you literally have to become one.

there's no faking it and the quickest way to become an expert in something is to teach it to other people according to research.

if you want to retain 90% of what you learn, the best way to do this is to teach or explain it to someone else. 

so you have to become obsessed\
learn everything you possibly can, that's going to help your audience and then teach it to them in your content as you learn. 

you don't have to put up a front and pretend to have all these client results and put fake screenshots of you making all this money that you don't have.

just share everything you know, that's going to help them get where you want to be and the experience and the client results will come. 



### step 3: Conversion

you're giving away everything you know for free in your content.

all the knowledge that's going to help them and then to monetize this you are going to sell the implementation.

**your product or your service is like the fast track to the result** that the person is looking for.


> [!warning] the mistake most people make is creating too many offers
> you think it must be easier to attract people, if you give them more  options, more services, that you can offer more things that you can sell to them but this is a huge mistake. **It overwhelms them.**


> [!warning] Confused people don't buy anything
> people need complete clarity on what you are offering them\
one service or product with a very clear result or transformation\
your content needs one very clear call to action

==an example of clear cta:==\
if you need help implementing what you learn in my content, work with me, buy from me, follow me, whatever it is just keep it simple and keep it consistent.

your content can come at it from a million different angles, but the
call to action is always the same.

everything you're sharing is leading them to one very clear offer.

You have to be consistent with your content & your cta for at least two months worth of momentum, before you can see any meaningful result.

**people need to see your call to action multiple times, before they actually take action**


you can switch up your call to action and your offers over time.\
in fact, you probably should do this.

because your first offer is not going to be a winner and so you want to be flexible and listen to your audience about what they want and so you can change your offers to fit their needs. 

but you want to focus on testing and promoting one offer at a time and then talk about it a lot.


### Step 4: System

you do not have to post every single day, but you have to be working on this at least once a day.

`ali abdal recommends post a content once/twice a week`

**the key to winning this game is not going viral, rather is doing it for
the longest time.**

so you need a routine to make it sustainable and easy to stay consistent.

forget about views forget about followers.\
your only measure of success is the number of pieces of content that
you finish and put out there.

this is the only way you're going to get better and improve create on one platform for one person about one problem once a day and repeat.

what you want to do is,\
put aside a realistic amount of time every single day to be working on this.

literally, schedule it into your calendar. Otherwise, you won't do it.

pick a realistic goal for the number of pieces of content, that you're going to make.\
**your only goal is to focus on getting out these pieces of content.**



### Consistency

Sometime you will get burned out, once you see your making contents for months and don't see any result. 

to tackle this you can,\
**learn new skills, take courses. As it gives a feeling of motivation & mental clarity.**\
not every course gonna led to huge breakthroughs or immediate results, but they'll always gives a feeling of motivation and fire you up & can give a moment of clarity.

second thing recommend doing is,\
**surrounding yourself with people who have the same Mission as you.**

it's really hard to keep going, especially when the people around you don't really understand what you're trying to do.

they don't understand, why you don't just give up and get a real job or they openly make fun of you for putting yourself out there online, it can be really lonely.

so having a community of people who gets you, makes all the difference.

you can find a lot of these people on YT channel, social platforms, comments.

> [!tip] you have to be ready to take action and fail a lot along the way 
> this is just something that anyone building any kind of business, has
to go through.


>[!quote] **attention is the new currency** 
once you get it right and build that audience,\
you will have an automated Sales Machine, qualified leads for your business with zero cold Outreach, and an audience ready to buy, whatever you want to sell them.
if you stick with it long enough, when everything eventually starts working\
you will be absolutely Unstoppable!
