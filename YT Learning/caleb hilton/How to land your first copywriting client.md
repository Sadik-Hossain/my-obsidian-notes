## The process
- **Get leads from fiverr (harlan)**\
	you get a spreadsheet of peoples with:
	names, title, company, email, website, linkedin, location
- **send them email, follow-up email, reach out to linkedin**
- **get them on a sales call & diagnose their situation & desired result**
- **validate & qualify, make sure there's no misunderstandings**
- **provide them with different options and close a deal**

## The harsh truth
---
People are looking for a copywriter or they're not.\
You're not going to convince them, that they need it at this point or not.\
You're pretty much scouting & knocking on the door and saying,\
"do you need a writer?"

**email template**\
**sub:**\
`Need any help with your content {Name}?`
**body:**\
```
Hi {NAME},

CurrencyTransfer came up for me on Linkedin and I think you have a great website.

Are there any marketing plans you have, like creating some extra landing pages or email campaigns? I'd love to help with them.

I'm sure you've thought about a blog too, which would be great for SEO.

Let me know if you think I can be of use, and we can have a discussion over the phone or via email.
