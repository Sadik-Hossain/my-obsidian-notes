#### Getting in Contact
##### Getting Permission & Sign Ups
**Transcript from the "Getting Permission & Sign Ups" Lesson**

[00:00:00]  

So where are we at? How far have we got along this journey? We have looked at pretty much everything that's involved in identifying the people that we wanna contact. We've identified how we can go about contacting them. We've made initial contact. We've done a survey. We've put together a report.

[00:00:22]  
Everything's looking great and wonderful, but we still don't have a mailing list. We don't have a group of people that we can talk to regularly. We've kind of taken a chance and contacted some people fairly cold, but they haven't given us their permission to talk to them on an ongoing basis.

[00:00:39]  
And we really need that because we don't wanna be emailing people all the time without their permission. So, why and how do we gain that permission? All right, so first off, why is ongoing communication so important? Why does it matter so much? Well, our survey and report will have got us on our audience's radar, but we need to stay on that radar really to give us a chance to build credibility in the minds of our audience.

[00:01:15]  
We need to be able to show them how great we are, okay? Then you can tell somebody, yeah, I'm an amazing developer, I do all this great work or whatever. But that is not as valuable as them discovering that from sales based on what they've learned about you, what they've heard about you, what they've read, that you've said, those kinds of things.

[00:01:38]  
So it's essential as well that we stay front and center in people's minds so that when they need our services we're instantly their preferred supplier, all right? So it's those two things that we need to stay front and center in the minds, we need to build credibility. And that's where regular contact via email can provide that.

[00:01:59]  
That's why on my website, at the bottom of every single page, you've got a call to action to sign up to my mailing list, cuz once I've got you on my mailing list, I've gotcha. That's it, you are at my mercy. So how do we gain the permission that we need?

[00:02:16]  
Well, there are several steps involved in this, and that will change a little bit over time as well. So the number one thing that we wanna do is we wanna promote the report, okay? So we're gonna contact our audience and tell them about the report. And we're also gonna reach out to those influencers, and we're also gonna use some other promotion techniques that I'm gonna get into in a moment.

[00:02:43]  
In addition to that, alongside the report, we probably want to offer a short email course that dives a little bit deeper into the issues that are found in the report. Now, don't worry, I know that sounds like a lot more extra work, but it really isn't. It's regurgitating what's in the report and adding a bit more detail.

[00:03:03]  
So it's not overly taxing, don't worry about it. And we're gonna use that really as the kind of next step. Okay, so you've downloaded the report. Now, you get these kind of series of introductory emails. And then once you've had that emails, then you're going on to that ongoing advice.

[00:03:23]  
So after people finish the course, they will continue to hear from you via monthly emails forever or bi-weekly or whatever you decide to do. So really, the report is done, that's your upfront work, piece of work done. Then we're gonna put together a short email course that only ever needs to be done once, all right?

[00:03:46]  
And then when people sign up, they're gonna get those over a series of weeks. So once you've done all of that, then really, your kind of week to week marketing is literally just doing those ongoing newsletters. All right, that's it. So right now, I'm not targeting a new audience, I'm not targeting anybody different.

[00:04:07]  
So my marketing activities consists of writing an email once every two weeks, right? So you can see how it does become lightweight. Yes, you need to block up some time to put everything in place to begin with, but once you've got it there, then it's a very lightweight process.

[00:04:24]  
So first of all, we need to design a landing page that encourages permission. So this is the point where people can get the report, and they can then go on and sign up for the email course and the ongoing emails. So what are the objectives of this landing page?

[00:04:42]  
It needs to establish your credibility. So why do I want emails from this person? Why do I care about what they do? We need to create a desire for the course and the report. We need to say, show people why that is worth having. We want to encourage people to sign up fairly obviously to the mailing list and at all stages.

[00:05:04]  
And it is not about selling your services, right? This is not the place to promote yourself, which means that we probably don't want to make this a part of our existing website, although it can share the design, right? So one of the questions I was being asked over lunch was, should I integrate this into my website?

[00:05:26]  
The answer is probably no. You can do if you really want to, but the minute you integrate it alongside your services and the stuff you're selling, it's suddenly all feels a lot more salesy, right? And I wanna focus it just on your giving away free advice. So you probably don't wanna do it.

[00:05:46]  
But you can reuse the design, if you want to, that's not a problem. So, what needs to go on this landing page? I touched on the earlier version of the landing page for the survey. This one is for the report in the email, so it's slightly different. You provide an outline of the main topics, the report covers, and what the email course will cover.

[00:06:08]  
And you maybe share a couple of key findings to get people interested, you'll be surprised to who is not nice, sounds very clip biting, I wont say out loud. [LAUGH] The three highest ranking sites based on our criteria were, find out how you ranked that kind of thing.

[00:06:33]  
Then we talk about the benefits that are provided by getting the report in the course. So you get instant access to the report, you get actionable advice on improving your site or app or whatever it is that you're targeting. You get awareness of the competitive landscape. You'll get evidence to support your requests of management.

[00:06:54]  
You'll get insights into areas of innovation. So you basically show the benefit that it provides. And then you add a couple of sentences about your own credibility. And then it's really about creating a compelling call to action. So this is the call to action that goes on my own website.

[00:07:12]  
This is just for my generic newsletter sign up. It kind of has got a lot of the key components. I know it looks like quite a lot of information, but that's okay if it's done in the right way. So what does a good call to action need to have on your landing page?

[00:07:29]  
It needs to be clear about what people are gonna get. So my case, my generic mailing list is Improve Your Knowledge of User Experience Design, Digital Marketing and Digital Leadership, right? And then it says you're gonna get emails every one to two weeks. You get a free course on getting design approval.

[00:07:46]  
A free course on building a user centric culture. So you can see how I'm outlining what it is you'll get. Now, here is an interesting one, it maybe, this is a little bit of a manipulative technique, and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. It popped into my head as I was preparing this workshop, and not something I've actively tried, but I'm gonna share it with you anyway.

[00:08:14]  
One thing you might wanna consider doing is allowing people to actually purchase the report if they don't want to sign up to your email list. Now, nobody will ever do that because why would you if you can get it for free from signing up for an email list?

[00:08:31]  
But it means you could put monetary value on the report, which makes the report look more valuable when you then get it for free. I don't know whether that's a bit manipulative. I can't quite work out whether I've just described a dark pattern or not, go on.  
>> You've also given them a value, you're getting their information as value to you.

[00:08:54]  
>> Yes, that's a good point, actually. So, I'm not sure quite how I feel about that, but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway. The other thing you might wanna do is consider making it free for a limited period, because that motivates people to sign up now and rather than later.

[00:09:11]  
And one of the really important things you call to action is make sure you handle any objections that people may have. So for example, people obviously are nervous about giving over their email address. So you wanna make it clear that you're not gonna sell it them. You wanna make it clear that they can unsubscribe in one click.

[00:09:32]  
And that you're never gonna share their email address with anybody. So you're really kind of reassuring them in the moment.

##### Create an Email Course

So let's talk quickly about this email course, because I've just suddenly dropped this on you. as another thing you've got to do. So, there are reasons for doing this, right? One is that it leads nicely, because there are some people you have promised to give the report to for free, whether they had sign up for the email or not, right?

[00:00:25]  
So anybody who's completed the survey, you've basically turned around to them and said, if you've completed the survey, I'm gonna give you the report, right? Everybody else, they will only get the report if they sign up for your emails. But that group that completed the survey, we also want to add, we want to encourage them to sign up.

[00:00:45]  
So, we want to give them a course that packs a little bit more of the report, and that encourages them to sign up. Also, the course is a nice little kind of introduction, if you like, to the report, builds on the report and adds to it. And then the way that the course will work is it's basically what's called a trigger-based campaign.

[00:01:08]  
So if somebody signs up today, they will get lesson one tomorrow, lesson two the day after, lesson three the day after. And if someone doesn't sign up for four days, they'll still get one, two, three, four, and those kinds of order. Does that make sense? So, that means that everyone is going through the same initial introduction, okay, no matter when they join.

[00:01:37]  
So they're not just being dumped into your mailing list at some random thing, where maybe you're ranting about something that's very time sensitive and not appropriate. Everybody gets that nice structured introduction. So that's why the course is worth doing. In terms of how you create your course, very simple, one email for each of the topics in your report, right?

[00:02:01]  
So we went six to eight topics, didn't we? And then you schedule those to go out once a week. So once somebody is subscribed, they get one a week. Now, I know that normally you might not be emailing them more than once a month. But it means to begin with, you're really building that relationship in those early days.

[00:02:19]  
So once a week, they get an email from their course. They only need to be about 500 words each. Don't need to be very long. They only need basic formatting to aid a bit scannability. And that's it, that's all there is to the structure of the course. When they finish the course, then they just get your monthly email or your biweekly email.

[00:02:41]  
Writing each email, right? Basically, it's really easy. You create a recap of what was said in the report, right? Recap briefly the challenge or piece of advice from the report that you're gonna focus on in that email. You're gonna give a little bit of advice, provide a few practical tips about how to address that challenge, or take them closer to that best practice.

[00:03:06]  
And then you're gonna encourage them to contact you if they're struggling or if they've got any questions, so we're beginning to encourage that contact. That's it, right? Really nice and simple. A side I wanna say at this point is with any of this, with the report, with the emails, the whole thing, don't ever hold back.

[00:03:26]  
Share all the advice that you have freely. Don't worry about people doing it for themselves and not hiring you. People are still gonna reach out to you because they don't have the time or they feel too intimidated by the topic to try it themselves. Don't worry about your competition reading it and copying you, right?

[00:03:45]  
You're always gonna be a step ahead. People are gonna hire you because they know and like you, not because somebody copied what you did, right? And the other thing is still do not sell. You don't need to sell in those emails, right? There's no need to promote your services actively.

[00:04:05]  
Be open about what you do, that's fine. You might wanna recommend to the reader that they might hire somebody to help them with this, but it doesn't have to be you, right? Don't push yourself at all, there's absolutely no need. And so that email series, those first six to eight emails that go out as part of this email course could be utterly automated, all right?

[00:04:35]  
People will enroll at different times, but they'll all pass through the same course. And again, I use ConvertKit to do this, which will handle all of that, including, to be honest, building the landing page as well. Right, so that's what you're gonna do from the landing page. People can sign up, they can get the report.

[00:04:55]  
And when they get the report, they get instantly. Then over the next few weeks, they get those emails, and then they go onto the normal mailing list. What about those people that took part in the survey or didn't take part in the survey, that cold list that we're contacting, what are we gonna do about them?

[00:05:13]  
Well, those people that participated in the survey, we're gonna drop them one last email. And it's gonna make it clear that the email is about the report and showing our appreciation. So our title is gonna be, Your promised report, with a big thank you. And then it's gonna say how much you appreciated them being involved in it and how they'd managed to help turn it into something bigger.

[00:05:37]  
You're then gonna tell them what the report ended up covering, thanks to their feedback and involvement. You're then gonna actually attach the report to the email, right, as a PDF file, so people can help themselves. Also, if you did do the review, the audit of their site, attach their scores to it as well so they can see their individual scores.

[00:06:06]  
And then you wanna just introduce this idea of the email series, what the email series is gonna cover. Finally, you say, if that email course sounds good, you can subscribe for free here. So you're not requiring that group to subscribe to get the report, because that group contributed to the survey, right?

[00:06:30]  
So you promised you'd give it to them, you're giving it to them, right? You're hoping they will also sign up to the email course as well, but there's no guarantee. For everybody else, if they want the report, they have to sign up for the email course, right? So they just get a variation, which is very similar.

[00:06:48]  
It just says, if you wanna download the report, get the email course, click here, okay? Right, so we got a landing page. We told a load of people about it. Hopefully, you've now got some sign ups, people who've gone in to get the report, or to get the email course, or to get both.

[00:07:07]  
So they're in there. There are now on our list. They're beginning to move through that email course very slowly. In the meantime, what are you gonna do? Now, you've got to start promoting that report, any opportunity you get.

##### Handling Influencers
**Transcript from the "Handling Influencers" Lesson**
[00:00:00]  
We wanna reach out to our influencers at this point. Now, there are many different ways of doing this and many different formats. But let's first of all look at the trouble with influencers, right? I get dozens of emails every week, pitching something to me, right? And I'm a relatively small influencer in a very niche field, right?

[00:00:28]  
And it just drives me nuts, right? Even a niche influencer like myself get dozens of emails asking me for links, to promote various stuff via social media. And with so much noise, a single email is not gonna get their attention, right? Now we've sent them a couple of emails, we have warmed them up a little bit.

[00:00:49]  
But really, if you wanna start building a relationship with these people and you want them to be promoting the report and that kind of thing. You're gonna need to engage with them a little bit better than that. You're gonna need to build a relationship with them, right? The best way of doing that is to be helpful.

[00:01:08]  
So, following them on social media, paying attention to what they're talking about, contributing to those conversations. Providing with help where you can, be encouraging and grateful, amplifying their content for them and re-sharing it, that kind of thing. And then only after you've built a bit of a report to the point where maybe they've contacted you directly once or twice and thanked you.

[00:01:39]  
Then at that point, you're probably in a position to reach out to them. And don't just immediately email them, but over social media just ask them, is it all right if I drop you an email, all right? So nurture that relationship first of all, rather than just going in with a cold email.

[00:01:57]  
And when you are emailing influencers, basically, the key there is to really go in and thank them for all that they've shared online. Be very honest about that you'd like their help, tell them that you wanna share stuff, but only after you've kind of established that relationship. Now if you get lucky earlier on in the process when you reach out to them previously, you might have either got an influencer who is willing to put their name on this and do this with you.

[00:02:35]  
In which case that changes the ballgame entirely, because you can use their name and reputation to promote the report. Or alternatively, they might have been willing to be interviewed for the report, in which case make sure you mentioned them in the report. And now you can go back and say, hey, thanks so much for that interview, I've included you in the report, here's a free copy of it, right?.

[00:02:59]  
When it comes to emailing influencing publications, again, I've provided you with a sample email. I'm not gonna go into all the details of why it is the way it is. But it's basically talking about what the report is, whether they'd share it with their audience, etc. So, you've done your best with your initial list to promote sort of the course and the report and you've shared it around.

[00:03:32]  
But we're not done yet because it's still gonna be a relatively small list you may well have less than 50 people on your list at this point. So we're gonna start, building on that and taking it to the next level. But before we do that, are there any questions out of that, what we've had so far?

[00:03:53]  
>> Does Paul recommend a separate domain, or removing all of the navigation on the rest of your site, or a landing pitch?  
>> Yeah, that's a fair comment, I do get that. I would probably stick with your same domain, why complicate things? But just create subdomain would seem logical to me.

[00:04:16]  
But I would remove all the navigation to the rest of the site. So that you're not overly pushing your services and things alongside that. So if you look at most of my, well, cards on the table, right? At the end of this, I'm gonna give you a link to get the slide deck.

[00:04:34]  
But am I gonna leave it there, of course I'm not, right? I'm also gonna ask you to sign up to my newsletter. So when you go to that page, you're gonna see for yourself that is not part of the main blog world sites on a subdomain. But there's no navigation, there's no mention of my services or anything like that there.

[00:04:52]  
So that's the kind of thing you're aiming at. So you can see for yourself when you download the slide deck, so hopefully that helps.

##### Re-posting Content

**Transcript from the "Re-posting Content" Lesson**

[00:00:00]  
>> We have put an immense amount of work into this so far, right? We have created an email course. We've created a report. We've audited a load of sites. We've made a load of contacts. We've done a lot of work, right? Now, I'm inherently lazy, okay? And I can't remember who said it, but somebody said about the best coders are lazy coders, cuz they reuse their code, right, and they write it in a modular way.

[00:00:33]  
Well, I'm exactly the same with content, right? We've put so much effort into all this content. We are gonna now squeeze that content till every drop has come out of it and we've got every piece of value. Because, let's be honest, we're not gonna wanna be recreating this amount of content on a regular basis.

[00:00:53]  
So now we've kind of exhausted that initial list of influencers and companies. We've contacted them as much as we can. If they've signed up, great. If they haven't, the moment has passed. But there are many, many more people we want to reach. So now we're gonna start to use some more traditional techniques of content marketing to achieve that.

[00:01:17]  
But we're gonna reuse and recycle the content that we've already created to generate that content for content marketing, right? Does that sentence makes sense? So we're gonna use everything that's in the emails and the report, and we are going to turn them into blog posts. We're gonna turn them into webinars.

[00:01:43]  
We're gonna turn them into social media updates. We're gonna turn them into guest speaking slots. We're gonna turn them into podcast interviews. We're gonna turn them into anything we can possibly think of. We are gonna dine out on that content for as long as we possibly can just as a frame of reference, right?

[00:02:01]  
Brad Frost, you guys probably know Brad Frost, the guy that came up with atomic design and really popularized design systems. Amazing guy, very talented. He dined out on atomic design for years, right? That was what he was hired for. That was what he was known for. Hey, I've done the same thing.

[00:02:23]  
Every time I write a book, that's it for four years. That's enough to keep me going, just saying the same thing in slightly different ways in slightly different mediums. So that is exactly what you guys are gonna do now. You're not gonna have to constantly come up with new stuff.

[00:02:36]  
We're just gonna take those things, and we're gonna repurpose them. So for example, we're gonna turn our report into posts. So ideally, we wanna take our content, right, that we've created in the report and turn them into guest posts on other people's sites, right? So all those influencers we were reaching out to, all those publications, we're gonna say, hey, we've got this amazing report.

[00:03:02]  
It would be wonderful if you promoted it. But if you'd like, I'll quite happily write you a guest post around some of the report's key findings, right? Brilliant, that's superb. So all you need to do, take the content, take one of the topics, or take the report as a whole, whatever you wanna do.

[00:03:22]  
Write a guest post. You've done all the hard work already. It will come together really quickly with no effort. However, failing that, if you can't get guest posts, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna research into some keyword phrases using a tool like kwfinder.com. Which allows you to research into different questions, maybe, that people ask.

[00:03:43]  
And we'll then create keyword-optimized blog posts designed to rank well on those different keywords, right? So these guest posts based on a report are really easy to create. You decide on a question that you answered in your report, and you use that question as the basis of your content.

[00:04:04]  
You write a post with using exactly the same editorial process I already talked about. You remember the write drunk, edit sober approach. And this is the critical bit, and where people often go wrong. You include a clear call to action in the post to signup for the report and email course.

[00:04:28]  
I started off by criticizing content marketing, right? And the big problem that I see with most people's content marketing approaches, most agencies and freelancers, is they write a blog post, they shove it on their website. They've written it about whatever popped into their head. Nobody reads it, cuz nobody visits their website.

[00:04:52]  
And even those people that do read it, they then go away and go, that was nice, and never think about it again. So instead, what we're doing, is we are creating articles specifically for our target audience. We're trying to get them shown or published on blogs where we know our audience are reading.

[00:05:14]  
And we're having a clear call to action at the end of it to try and encourage them to give us their email address so that we can keep in contact with them. And that is the underlying principle. Whatever you do, whether you run a webinar, whether you run a course, whether you do a social media update, whether you write a blog post, whatever you do, it needs to have a clear call to action.

[00:05:40]  
Otherwise there's no point of doing it, right? If there's not a value that's coming out of it, I mean, if you're speaking at a conference for free, or going to a local meetup, or doing any of these stuff, and you don't try and capture someone's email, there's very little value in it compared to this.

[00:06:00]  
And then, of course, whatever that post is, you're gonna promote it on social media. But you can also turn your report into a webinar. So considering running a webinar based on your report. But I'll wait for that until maybe you've built up a bit of a following on social, or on your mailing list, because obviously, otherwise no one's gonna come to the webinar, right?

[00:06:25]  
The thing about a webinar, the reason that it's something worth considering, is because up until this point, we haven't had any face-to-face contact with our potential audience, right? And webinars are a great way of engaging with your audience in a kind of personalized way. So you could have read a course on this.

[00:06:50]  
It could have been a written course, right, where you read all of the instructions I've shared with you today. But you wouldn't felt like you got to know me like you have from listening to me, right? You wouldn't have got a sense of my sense of humor, or maybe my pragmatic nature, or my Britishness, or whatever it is.

[00:07:08]  
All of those things are the kinds of things that influence your decision of whether to hire someone or not. So a webinar is actually a really good way of beginning to make that kinda connection with people. But then, maybe don't do that on day one, but it's certainly worth considering.

[00:07:25]  
If you're gonna do it, it only needs to be about 40 minutes, along with maybe 20 minutes for questions. Cover maybe three of the key findings in the report. That's probably all you need to cover. So again, all the contents written for you. Add the webinar to your landing page where the report is.

[00:07:44]  
Once you've done it, you can record it, put it on their landing page. It actually adds credibility to the landing page. And then consider maybe approaching some meetups in your areas or conferences in your areas and saying look, here's a webinar I did online. Would you like me to come and do it for your group?

[00:08:04]  
So then you can start getting in front of audiences and talking about some of this stuff. Now you might think that all sounds very scary. And public speaking's not for everybody. And if it really terrifies you, by all means, don't do it. There are other opportunities that are available to you.

[00:08:24]  
But I think you'll be surprised how you feel once you've finished the report, because you'll be very confident in the material, right? You'll know exactly what you're talking about. You'll have statistics, and quotes, and all these kinds of things that will make it so much easier to do.

[00:08:41]  
So yeah, have a think about that. And then, of course, you need to be promoting your course and your report on social media. But again, even this is so much easier, because you've got all this material to work with. So you can take the material from your report and your email course, pull out snippets, turn them into pictures and put them on Instagram, turn them into text and put them on Twitter.

[00:09:12]  
So for example, there's all kinds of things that come straight out of that report that you can just regurgitate and people will love to share. Things like statistics, we've got statistics from the survey. Everybody likes sharing statistics. It makes them look clever. Did you know that people only read an average of 25% of the content on a web page?

[00:09:33]  
Well, that's true. Jacob Nielsen did research on this. So now you think how intelligent Paul is. That could just trip off that fact, that figure isn't actually right. I think it's 24%, but anyway. So statistics are a really good thing to share. You've got great quotes from people within the industry, right?

[00:09:55]  
Because hopefully you've spoken to a few people by this stage, put that in the report. And now you can quote that on social media. And of course, if people were mentioned on social media, what do they do? They reshare it, they retweet it, so that spreads it further.

[00:10:13]  
Then also, you can share little practical actions and advice that help people. So you made little recommendations in the report, so you can rechurn those and put those into social media updates. I would recommend where possible, use some video and audio. You can take bits maybe from the webinar if you did that.

[00:10:35]  
Or you can create little audio grams which are tiny little kind of audio snippets. Quotes in the report can be shown as nice images. There's some great tools out there to make them look fancier. Tableau is just one, but there are others. And then of course, critically, whenever you do any of these things, you end with and for more information, see our report, and you link through to the landing page.

[00:11:03]  
Also throw in a few relevant hashtags, just for good measure for those people that follow such things, and mention influences where relevant. Now, you might be thinking, okay, I'm Paul, hang on a minute. You said that once we were done with the big heavy lifting at the beginning that I only had to do to one email every two weeks, right?

[00:11:27]  
And now you've thrown in social media on top of this. Don't think I haven't noticed, you liar. Well, I'm not actually lying, because my entire social media feed is automated. I don't write my social updates. I mean, obviously I wrote them once the first time, but I don't send them out individually.

[00:11:48]  
Instead I use a tool called CoSchedule, which has got two really good features that make life so much easier, and mean that I don't have to keep thinking of social media updates. First is that I can schedule updates through an editorial calendar. So for example, it plugs into WordPress.

[00:12:08]  
So every time I release a blog post, I then have said, okay, when this blog post is released, send out this post. A day after it's been released, send out this post. A day after that, send out this post. A week after that, send this one. A month after that, send this one.

[00:12:27]  
So I line up a whole load that are associated with any particular post that I put out or announcement. And then the other feature that its got, which is really nice, is it will then fill in the gaps, right? So between those ones that are very small specifically scheduled, I've also got a whole bank of these quotes and statistics, and stuff like that, that I've taken out my reports, and my books, and various things over the years.

[00:12:57]  
And I've literally got hundreds of them that have built up over the years. They're in a massive big bank, and basically CoSchedule goes in, picks them out, fills in the gaps, and shoves them out. And it will monitor which ones perform best and put those out more often.

[00:13:12]  
And it will ensure that you don't have the same one going out more than x amount of time, and all of these kinds of things you can set up. So it means you can automate your whole social media feed based off of your single report, right? Wow, that's social media done, okay?

[00:13:30]  
And obviously, it posts across different platforms as well. So let's recap. We're beginning to build our mailing lists. We're establishing contact. How are we doing that? We're doing that by writing an email course around the report findings. We're gonna create a landing page that sells that report and that email course.

[00:13:51]  
We're gonna email our cold email group, the initial audience with our report. We're gonna reach out to our influences. And then we're gonna recycle the heck out of our content in two kinds of different formats to attract a bigger audience over time. And we're gonna automate our social media to avoid it becoming a pain in the neck.
####  Growing Your Audience

##### Growing Your Audience
**Transcript from the "Growing Your Audience" Lesson**
[00:00:00]  
>> We should have, by this stage, a small but growing mailing list. That's the hope, and don't despise those small beginnings when you've only got 50 people on your mailing list. That's a good start, you're doing well. And it does take time for these mailing lists to grow, but they tend to grow exponentially after a certain length of time.

[00:00:26]  
I remember from very long time, I felt like I was stuck at a certain ceiling and then suddenly an event happened, something happened, I can't even remember what. And the growth started, and things became much better over time. So don't give up too early. I think the message there is I see people giving up way too early on this kind of thing, when they don't see the results that they want straight away.

[00:00:54]  
So we've got our small core that we're starting with, how do we grow from there? How do we maintain and look after, nurture that audience over time. Well, a lot of this will come down to the planning of our regular emails. So once we get past that email course where people are on-boarded effectively, then you're beginning to get into the kind of regular emails that you send out.

[00:01:22]  
Now, I think there's something that I need to say at this point as well, that over time you may decide to target multiple sectors. So you might initially have done like no charities and whatever. And you went through and you did the report and the survey and everything, and you got that up and running, you got an email course for that up and running.

[00:01:41]  
And then you decide you wanna target higher education. And that doesn't mean that you get rid of the charities one. So you've got some people that will be still coming in via that route, and now you're gonna basically copy and paste for a different sector. Now you probably can keep a lot of the report, a lot of the emails, a lot of everything, and reuse it for a different sector with some changes.

[00:02:08]  
But what this ultimately means is you've got some people coming in from one sector and some people coming in from another. They're going through two separate email courses, and then they're merging into one overall list. So, what that effectively means is that our regular emails that go out are gonna have to be not as sector specific.

[00:02:31]  
Unless we want to tag users which we can do, based on which sector they've come from, which campaign they've come from, and then do separately tailored emails for each audience. Now personally, I think in most cases that's overkill. So on my own mailing list for example, I know whether people come from a particular background, or they work in a particular sector or whatever else based on where they signed up.

[00:03:00]  
But most of the time they will get the same email irrespective of what sector they came from, in terms of the regular ongoing email. Now, there are occasionally, I will write a topic where I wanna say slightly different things to different audiences, and that's fine, I can do that.

[00:03:17]  
But most of the time I wanna keep the work level manageable and not have to write double or triple the number of emails in any one particular week. So don't worry about overly worried about that, think more about writing generic emails and we'll get into how to write those emails in a minute, and how to go about organizing yourself.

[00:03:38]  
But before we do that, I wanna talk about how your different channels fit together. Because you've got different channels that you will be using. You've got email, you've got your blog probably and you've got social, and the relationship between all of those is quite important to get right.

[00:03:58]  
Because if you get those right then they reinforce one another, and don't involve a lot of extra work the whole time. So, let's look at the role of each. Social, the role of social is to grab people's attention and encourage them to share your content and to drive traffic to a blog post on a related subject.

[00:04:20]  
Normally speaking that's what they are. Your blog has two roles. First is to attract traffic through SEO-targeted posts. So as I said before, if you can't write guest posts for other people, you can write posts on your own site that are targeted with their SEO. But they should also drive people to your landing page as well.

[00:04:48]  
So, social grabs our attention, blog hopefully is a kind of intermedia to drive them to the landing page that gets them on to email. And once on your mailing list, email will keep them front of mind, slowly building your credibility until they're ready to buy. So that's their separate roles, but you can do a lot of doubling up.

[00:05:15]  
So, for example, in my situation I released an email this morning that went out. That email was also replicated as a blog post. Same content, just I released it as a blog post at the same time, okay? And I took bits out of that email and used those to create the social media updates that drove people to the blog post, that had a sign-up form for the email.

[00:05:46]  
You got me? So that same email gets reused three times in three places. Now actually, because I'm a sucker for punishment or I don't know why, I also do a video version of that. That video version appears in the blog post and is posted to YouTube. I then also extract the audio from that and release it as a podcast.

[00:06:11]  
So from that one email, I've got a blog post, social media updates, video and podcast, okay? From one single email. And that's what you're looking to do, to reach people in whatever channel they're using with the same content. So let's look where all of that starts with email, right?

[00:06:31]  
The email that you're gonna be sending out every other week, every month, whatever you decide. So what do you want to include in those emails, right? Well, the first thing to say is they have to be personal, right? These emails mustn't read like a marketing material. They need to be as if you were talking to someone.

[00:06:52]  
Well, the British answer to this is, if you were talking to someone in a pub, in your case maybe a coffee shop, but we won't quibble, whatever fits with your culture. But in an informal atmosphere, you're just chatting over a subject and you're trying to keep it as informal, and friendly and personal as you possibly can.

[00:07:10]  
Like you would write any other email really. The majority of emails that we write to colleagues, they don't read like a marketing email and neither should yours. What I find helps me, is if I think of somebody I know and I actually write my emails for that person, right?

[00:07:29]  
And I even start, Hi Sarah or whatever, the beginning, just to get me in that mindset, then I do have to remember to go up and remove their name afterwards. Otherwise that ends up getting published, which did happen once, but anyway. So they should be personal, they should also be helpful.

[00:07:50]  
So every email should provide value to the reader, right? So that could be in the form of advice, but it might be just about demonstrating empathy over their challenge. Some of my emails are nothing more than me moaning about something, right? And not necessarily even giving the answers to how to overcome that.

[00:08:11]  
But it's amazing how grateful people are to receive an email that says effectively you're not alone, I face those problems too, right? So be helpful, be empathetic. And then the final thing is just even now, even all the way through this process that we've got, you still don't need to sell.

[00:08:33]  
You don't need to mention your services, you don't need to sell them. It's okay to say something like, as I was preparing a workshop that I'll be giving on finding clients, that's fine, right? It occurred to me that, [SOUND] that's about as sales-y as you get, right? Because, effectively the knowledge and expertise that you are sharing will be you're selling, right?

[00:09:00]  
That's how you demonstrate your expertise and knowledge. So that's what should be included in emails, but there are some common mistakes that I see people make with these kinds of ongoing, well, it applies to blogging as well. Anything, emails and your blog, there things I see again and again, and it's why so often these kinds of attempts fail.

[00:09:25]  
The first one is inconsistencies, right? So what do I mean by that? You got to decide on a release schedule and then stick to it. The same time, the same day, every single time, right? Set aside time to work on these emails. They matter as much as your client work does, right?

[00:09:47]  
Building your own business is as important as building other people's businesses in the services that you provide. So you've really got to be incredibly regimented about these things. People have got to come to expect your emails. So I had some technical problems a few weeks ago where my email didn't send out.

[00:10:09]  
And obviously I'd scheduled it and presumed had gone out, and within an hour people started dropping me emails going, you got a problem? I got your email this week, right? That's a really great sign. Secondly is infrequent, right? Readers cannot be allowed to forget about you, if you only email them a couple of times a year they'll forget you exist.

[00:10:34]  
So I recommend at least once a month. And so, if you're in that mindset of I'll send an email out when I've got a gap between client work, you're gonna fail, right? Simple as that. Either, it's not gonna be regular enough and so people are gonna forget about you, or you're gonna forget to do it, or it's gonna be totally infrequent.

[00:10:57]  
So people aren't gonna expect your emails, they're not gonna look forward to them or anything like that. And then the final mistake I see is promotional again. I know I keep saying don't sell and I really mean that. Your advice is gonna establish your expertise and the topics you write about will show your readers the kind of services you offer.

[00:11:17]  
I don't need to say I provide conversion rate optimization services, I just need to talk about conversion rate optimization.

##### Creating New Content
 
So one of the concerns that I hear from people whenever I talk, how do you do it Paul, how do you keep coming up with content? You're always coming up with new things to talk about, how do you manage it? I can never think about what to write.

[00:00:16]  
I totally get that, and the reason that you're struggling is because you're sitting down and going, what shall I write about today, right? And you know what happens if anybody puts you on the spot, and say something, you blank, you can't think of anything. So you need to avoid that.

[00:00:36]  
So really, ultimately, it's about just building up an ongoing list of topics. And a lot of that is just about you're surrounded by ideas all the time. You just need to pay attention and write it down so that when you sit down to write an email, you've already got ideas there.

[00:00:56]  
So, pay attention to the conversations you're having with clients. They'll ask you questions. That's an email, right? You'll get stuck on a project and frustrated on a project. That's an email. Keep an eye out for subjects being discussed on the influencer sites, the sites that your audience are hanging out at.

[00:01:19]  
Those are all potential emails. Every question that's asked on a forum, every search that's done on Google related to a particular subject, every mention on social media. Those are all email topics. Think about the work you're doing at that particular time. That's all content, right? I've been working at the moment on doing usability testing.

[00:01:45]  
That's a subject. And I had a particularly bad experience recently where I did usability testing, and we were benchmarking my version against the existing version and my version performed worse than the existing version, right? I actually wrote an email saying how to deal with [LAUGH] when your usability test fails.

[00:02:13]  
That's a good subject. And people wrote to me afterwards going, I'm so glad it's not just me. [LAUGH] Or I really appreciated your honesty there. It's great. Write about services you offer, not directly, but write around those services. Don't say this is a list of the services I offer, but write about topics relating to those services.

[00:02:36]  
Pretty obvious really. And write about the value of what you want to offer. So if you want more work, I don't know, doing usability testing, then you write about the value of usability testing. It's not rocket science. Also pay attention to what annoys you. This is really good, cuz it will annoy other people as well.

[00:03:02]  
So for example, I really get annoyed by cookie notifications. They are something that really grinds my gears, logins as well, that's another pet subject of mine which really irritates me. So I'm always writing about these things cuz they annoying me. And then keep an eye out for good examples, right?

[00:03:23]  
You live in a world full of examples, you're interacting with it every day. So me as a user experience person, every app I use, every website I visit, they're all potential good examples that I can refer to. If you work in performance, then you're gonna see good and bad examples of well performing or poorly performing sites.

[00:03:47]  
So that's all material you can draw upon. And if all else fails, research what people are Googling. If you type in user experience or performance and see what comes up afterwards, then it's great. Well, actually if you hit return, so you type in performance hit return, get the results up, actually it's a block of questions related to that topic, right, in the Google results.

[00:04:16]  
Those are all emails you can send out. And then if you're struggling with topics then on any particular topic there are so many different ways you can approach that topic. You can write reviews of different products. You can ask questions. You can do how tos. You can share industry news.

[00:04:35]  
You can talk about controversial subjects. You can create checklists and cheat sheets. You can create case studies and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on. You really don't need to run out of ideas. The trick is not starting from a blank sheet, not sitting down to write an email without existing ideas.

[00:05:00]  
And so the way that I resolve this is by starting to keep a list of possible ideas. Now I use Notion. Where in Notion I have basically ideas split out as to whether they're a course or an email or a webinar or a social media update or whatever else.

[00:05:21]  
And then I jot down the title of the subject I wanna cover and maybe a few bullet points on it and just leave it at that until it comes time to next write. And every time you have an idea, you just drop it into the list along with a few bullet points to help you get started when it comes time to write it.

[00:05:39]  
And so once in a while I will also sit down and just brainstorm a load of ideas to keep the list topped up. But I don't do that at the moment I'm gonna sit down and write because that's when your mind goes blank. So are there any questions around coming up with ideas or writing emails or any struggles that you have around that kind of thing?

[00:06:01]  
Is it something you've ever tried doing?  
>> Outside of selling like to not talk about that, is there anything else you would say to avoid?  
>> Not really ,I think a lot of people are afraid of expressing their opinions because someone will tell them they're wrong, which I totally understand and totally get.

[00:06:21]  
And if that is you, I would say you don't need to be afraid of that because people will tell you you're wrong even if you say nothing, right? I've received emails before saying, why haven't you spoken out on so and so an issue on. Okay, I hadn't even said anything and I'm in trouble.

[00:06:40]  
So some degrees you can't win that. But if you are worried, if you're one of those people that, I don't wanna put my head above the parapet because people might criticize me. Then my advice is stick to talking about your personal experience because nobody can say that that was wrong.

[00:06:56]  
That was what happened to you in your situation. Or focus on quoting other people, so and so says, or I noticed this, so those kinds of things. But no, I think, really, you shouldn't be afraid to express your opinion. One of the things I'm about to come onto is finding your own voice as you write.

[00:07:23]  
And I think that it's okay to recognize not everybody's gonna agree or like what you say, and that's all right. Also you don't need everybody to like you just need enough people to keep you in business, right? But yeah, that is tricky one. Yeah, have got a question from chatroom?

[00:07:42]  
>> Have you tried different processes like drafting in batches?  
>> Yes, I have. And that might work for you, it didn't work for me. The reason it didn't work for me is because, I've said it once, I will say it again, I have the attention span of a small child.

[00:08:00]  
So siting and batching a whole load of emails never really worked for me. I'm very much a person that gets enthusiastic in the moment about something, right? Something has particularly hit me, and so I wanna write an email about it there and then, okay? So actually, although I've got these backlog of ideas, I only use those if I really get stuck.

[00:08:25]  
Most of the time, something's popped into my head and I wanna write about it straight away. So doing a whole load I would find a bit tedious. But there's no reason why not, and in actual fact that's probably a good way of doing it, have a whole load lined up ready to release.

[00:08:40]  
I always try and be one ahead of myself in case I get ill or something like that, and so I've always got something to go out. But no, I don't batch that much.

##### Find Your Voice

[00:00:00]  
>> So let's talk about this idea of finding your voice, when you write emails. Old blog posts or, due speaking or anything really, why is this important? Why is this a subject I'm even talking about in this course? And it's because personality is how we win business at the end of the day, right?

[00:00:22]  
More so than your skills, more so than anything else. I mean, look at myself, I'm a good user experience designer, but I'm not the best by any stretch of the imagination. There are many more well qualified people to teach user experience design than me, but they don't, all right?

[00:00:52]  
And that's because, although they're very good at what they do, they don't market themselves, they don't have the personality to maybe come out and do this kind of thing. So, I guess what I'm getting at is we're not hired just on our ability, we're hired on lots of different factors, personality is a big part of that.

[00:01:17]  
When we write online, we've got this impression that we have to be professional, right? And we have to write in this certain way and it makes us so dull, right? And I fallen into this before. Of I need to be a bit more professional and so I stopped joking, I stopped messing around which is me, that is who I am.

[00:01:40]  
That's my personality. I make quips and throwaway comments to get me in enormous trouble, that's just part of who I am. But I was repressing that and I must be considered, I must be professional. And actually that's detrimental at the end of the day because you can only be who you are, and if we try and strip out our personality, it just leads to dull and unengaging content.

[00:02:10]  
Your personality is the one thing that your competitors can't replicate. Not everyone will like you, that's fine. There are a lot of people that strongly dislike me. But enough people will like you to sustain your business and that's what ultimately matters. And if people do like you, then they'll listen to you, and if they listen to you, they'll come to trust you, and if they come to trust you, they'll buy from you.

[00:02:42]  
So personality really is a very powerful tool for winning work and we need to stop trying to put on a face of professionalism in everything we do. Because I deal with really big hired organizations. I deal with, C-suite people. But at the end of the day they're all human beings, they all laugh, they'll joke, they will make mistakes in work, they're just like anybody else, and so you need to connect with them just like anybody else.

[00:03:19]  
You don't treat them like some kind of corporate bot that you have to program in a certain way with the words you use. Effectively, I think it boils down to this, be more of what you already are, right? One of the things I see a lot is you can't be anybody else, so don't try, right?

[00:03:41]  
So, the best one, I'm almost back on well, I am embarrassed to say this right? I'm quite an outgoing person and I'm quite informal, but I came across Gary Vaynerchuk. I don't know whether you've ever followed him, and I went through a period of time where I just saw I want to be like him.

[00:04:03]  
I don't know why, cuz he annoys me now but at the time, I wanna be like him and I tried to be like Gary Vaynerchuk and it was a train wreck. I was just such an idiot, It wasn't me. And you can only be who you are. And there was another time there's this guy that I really admire a guy called Carmela Moles ,who is just as well spoke quietly spoken, when he speaks it's words of wisdom.

[00:04:31]  
And you go, wow. And I wanted to be like him, but I couldn't, because I gamble and I talk rubbish half the time. And it's like, no, you just be yourself, to be a little bit more of yourself than you would be normally, right? Instead just exaggerate, a little bit of who you are, to make it more obvious.

[00:04:52]  
So for example, I'm enthusiastic and passionate, I get excited and I might want to be, and so I'm more of that. If could you imagine how annoying I'd be to live with if I had this level of excitement and monster energy drinks the whole time, if I talked like this the whole time, my wife would kill me.

[00:05:15]  
But it is naturally in my personality, it comes out more when I do stuff like this. When I write, I'm more flippant than I would be normally. I'm a little bit more of what I am now perhaps you are someone who is really considered and thoughtful, that's fine, then amp that up, be really considered and thoughtful, right?

[00:05:33]  
No personality type is wrong when it comes to this stuff. You just got to be a little bit more than you are. You don't need to appeal to everyone, the Internet is a big place. And there are a lot of potential clients out there and someone is going to love who you are.

[00:05:49]  
It sounds like something in a self help book that doesn't it? You can find your perfect partner. Someone will love you for who you are, but it's true. It really is, right? And then going back to what we talked about a minute ago, have opinions, don't just recycle the thoughts of others.

[00:06:06]  
I know it's kind of scary expressing your opinions, but it's really worthwhile and people want to know your perspective. And a lot of us go, we look around and we look at other people in our industry. We go yeah, they really know their stuff, all right? I could never be as good a communicator as then.

[00:06:26]  
No, you couldn't be the same as them, but actually your way of explaining things, your way of talking about things, will appeal to a different group. Some people, for example, I really admire this guy called Jeremy Keith, who is, I just love the way he talks. But I know for a lot of people, he's too intellectual it just go, it's like, that's all theoretical, which is kind of goes over their heads, and he's not for people like that.

[00:06:57]  
And so maybe my voice is more appealing for people like that I don't know. So basically, you have got your place in all of this, you have got your market, you've got your space. And I would encourage you to express your own opinions. Maybe write yourself a bit of a personal manifesto, right?

[00:07:18]  
What is it you care about, right? What are your big passion? So for me, right at the top of my list is accessibility. I believe the web should be for everybody, right? That's one of my fundamental principles that I believe. What really annoys me, right, what don't I believe, what don't I like?

[00:07:37]  
Well I've got this real deep hatred of dark patterns they irritate me, okay? What do I believe in, what not just what do I care about? What do I believe in? I believe in the fact that it what's good for the user, is good for the business. These are my fundamental underlying principles that shape what I share online, and what I stand for.

[00:07:59]  
So people when they mentioned Paul Boac, they kind of know what he cares about, what he's into. So, there's a little bit of advice. So it all got a bit little airy fairy there for a minute. I'm sorry about that. But it is worth thinking about who you are, how you're gonna present yourself and how you're gonna communicate as you begin to build your list and give yourself a little bit confidence.

[00:08:23]  
The other thing I will say, which is not in the slide deck, but when you start, you'll be rubbish, right? All of my blog posts back to 2005 are all on the BI world website. If ever you're feeling bad about your content, and you think you're rubbish, go back through my archives and read what I wrote in 2005.

[00:08:41]  
It will be a train wreck, right? And even better if you really want a giggle, right, go and look at my podcasts that started in 2005. When my first podcast is me sitting on a mic going, today I want to talk about all accessibility of PDF files. And then I drone on like this for a very long time.

[00:09:10]  
I mean it's appalling it's a train wreck, right? So check those out and make you feel better about yourself. And to begin with, the thing you've got reassure yourself tougher this nobody's going to be list watching to begin with. Nobody's gonna be reading to begin with, your mailing list is going to be tiny to begin with.

[00:09:25]  
So, that's the time to make the mistakes because nobody's going to know, anyway let's move on.

##### Referrals & Growing Your Email List

[00:00:00]  
>> Let's talk about growing that list, cuz we don't want it to be tiny forever, I mean, in actual fact, your subscribers are the best way to grow your reach, right? You wanna encourage your subscribers to recommend your list to others and to feel able to recommend your services despite them not having personally worked with you, right?

[00:00:21]  
This is a really weird one, normal word of mouth comes from, yeah, I've worked with this guy he's really good. Most of my word of mouth recommendations come from, here's a guy I've followed for ages he's really good, right? Most of them haven't even worked with me but they still recommend me to other people, so anything you can do to encourage your users to start spreading the word about you, you should absolutely do.

[00:00:43]  
So how do you do that? How do you turn your users Into advocates, your readers into advocates, well, connect with them, right? Take opportunities to actually talk with them, so you can do this in lots of different ways, you can ask them questions and get them to reply to you, right?

[00:00:59]  
You can run surveys in your emails from time to time, you could start debates, I pick controversial subjects and let people argue it out with one another in a in a safe environment. I've got Slack channel where we do that, and I'm the arbiter that says, [INAUDIBLE] no, you've gone too far there.

[00:01:17]  
[LAUGH] Ask for help, that's one of the best ways of getting your audience to engage with you is by going, I'm stuck on something, can anyone help me? It's amazing, cuz people love the idea that after they've been getting advice from you for ages, suddenly they can help you.

[00:01:34]  
So that's a really good way of connecting with people, do meetups, right? I know it sounds stupid but after a while you'll have a few followers, right? And okay, they might be spread out over the world and so you can't do a in person meet up, but just start up a Zoom call every two weeks over COVID.

[00:01:57]  
In fact was every week when COVID was particularly bad, we just, on a Friday afternoon, I'd open a Zoom call up and invite people for my mailing list and Slack channel and Twitter. Come and hang out together, we've got to know each other and it was great, just spent a bit time together, and get them connecting with each other as well.

[00:02:18]  
So that's why I like having a Slack channel where they can talk to one another, cuz there's this great thing it's stupid story, right? Let's say, I give a really silly example of this cuz it's more entertaining, doing it this way. Imagine we went out after this, we all went out, we went to the pub, right?

[00:02:37]  
We're sitting in the pub together, and we're chatting and getting to know one another, and I turn around and I say, I collect paper clips, right? Now, by this stage, you've had a couple of pints you're quite relaxed with me, I know, maybe not cuz you're nicer than British people, but I know you will mercilessly tease me for that.

[00:03:01]  
I mean, who collects paperclips, right? And so I'm then gonna get a bit shy and a bit embarrassed that I clicked paper clips and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. Now imagine the same scenario, but when I say I collect paper clips, Mark goes, you don't so do I, and then we start infusing together about how cool it is to collect paper clips.

[00:03:25]  
Now that's changed the dynamic all of a sudden, we're reinforcing one another, and you too was sitting there going, well perhaps paper clips are cool? I don't know, am I missing something in here? And that's what happens when you connect your followers to one another, they start reinforcing each other going, I like Paul's work too, yeah, I find him inspiring.

[00:03:48]  
Fact that everybody finds me inspiring just makes me giggle but I do get emails like that, so yeah, they reinforce one another and it's great. So connecting users to one another, you building their relationship is really important, the other thing I do a lot is I try and show my appreciation to those people that follow me.

[00:04:08]  
I'm thanking people all the time, I do giveaways, so, if ever I get offered free stuff, I get a lot of people write to me and go, we want you to try out this cool new app or whatever. And so, which will happen as you get a bit of an audience, and these days, I say, no, but I'll give it away to somebody else, right?

[00:04:31]  
It's great, free stuff for people there on my mail list, why not? The other thing I do sometimes is random acts of kindness, so if I got a bit of spare time, which doesn't happen that often, but I'll drop out one of my mails also emails. I'll say, I've got bits free time, anybody need any help with anything free a charge, all right?

[00:04:54]  
And you'd think you'd getting inundated with people going, yeah, yeah, but you don't, people very sheepishly write to you and go, if you can spare me just a few minutes to do this, and it's like, why not? Why not help them out? It's a nice thing to do, and then just asking people how you can do better?

[00:05:12]  
What do they want help with? What are they struggling with? How can you be there for them? So you can do that, and then finally, once you've done those things, then you can start encouraging referrals cuz you kind of built a bit of social credit with them. So you make your newsletter easy for sharing for start, so, that's why all of my newsletter emails, also make available as blog posts so that people can easily share them with other people.

[00:05:38]  
You can do things or offer commission and stuff, I'm not a massive fan of the idea of commissions and if they refer people. But you can offer them something in return, maybe, I've tried that before, but anything really, but then oftentimes I just asked politely, can you help me out, I'm really trying to grow the list.

[00:06:04]  
One of my favorites of all time that I did [LAUGH] I can't believe I did this on my list but they were brilliant over it, I wrote this is about honesty and personality. I wrote an email that said, I'm coming up to the end of the month and I really wanna buy myself a new camera, right?

[00:06:25]  
But my wife has told me I'm not allowed it, unless I get over our agreed target by the value of the camera, and I'm sure 800 pounds or whatever it was. Anybody willing to hire me for 800 [LAUGH] pounds so I could meet the target and people did, right?

[00:06:48]  
They contacted me and said, I'll take a couple of hours or an hour's worth of consultancy or whatever, different things I did. Just from being honest and asking nicely and with humanity rather than being some sales bot. And then also you can occasionally, and you got to word this in the right way, but you can ask people well, why don't you recommend me?

[00:07:14]  
Am I doing something wrong? Is there something I could be doing better? But you have to ask that in a non accusatory way [LAUGH] you sound like a bit of an ass. Right, but obviously, there are loads of other ways that you can build your list beyond just passively waiting for your followers to refer you.

[00:07:38]  
You can do those search engine optimized blog posts I talked about, you do the webinars we've discussed, you can do speaking podcast guests that's a really good one. There's loads of podcasts, they're constantly looking for guests, you've got something good to talk about, why not? You could do more cold emailing, you could reach out to people individually, don't do bulk emails, don't buy a list or anything stupid like that.

[00:08:05]  
But if there are a few people you encounter that you really would like to connect with, that's okay. There's obviously your social media, there's community engagement as well, getting involved in things like that higher education mailing list I mentioned, LinkedIn or Google Ads. Now they're a little bit more worthwhile considering because you've got a call to action that isn't just by me, it's signed up for my mailing list so you can nurture that relationship, promote the report, etc.

[00:08:37]  
Guest posts, obviously I've talked about, you could decide, okay, I'm done with that sector, I'm not getting any further, let's try a different sector and repeat the whole process. And then finally you can do the going generic approach, so I'm kinda now at the stage where I've built my profile enough that is that I've got the sectors I particularly target.

[00:09:02]  
But I do allow people to sign up to my newsletter just Willy Nally not through a specific landing page or from a specific sector. So a lot of my growth now actually just comes from people stumbling across me through various means and not through a specific campaign. But I would leave you with this when it comes to growing your list, don't abandon a sector too soon.

[00:09:27]  
I see a lot of people kinda giving up before just before they're about to make it, and it's frustrating to watch, and really it comes down to monitoring what works and what doesn't. So, for example, I'll be honest with you guys that like I said at the end, you will go to a landing page to get the slides from today and you can see an example of the landing page.

[00:09:51]  
Landing pages I build on screen now through Convert Kit, and I'll pay attention, right? So I'll look, how many did the finding clients course lead people to sign up for my mailing list? And that wasn't as successful as the design processes course, i'll probably focus on that one a little bit more.

[00:10:13]  
Or hey front end masters is a really good way of reaching people with a that leads to a lot of people signing up for my mailing list. [INAUDIBLE] Grovel to Mark and see if I can persuade him to let me do another course, things like that so really pay attention to what works and what doesn't.

[00:10:33]  
So you're not wasting your time on channels that don't really take you anywhere. And I think it's important that we've kind of just before we move on to turning all of this into an actual business, that we just look at remembering that ultimately that ongoing Emails. That you're sending out every two weeks needs to be appropriate to a broader audience than just your initial group that you targeted, so you're gonna need to segment your audience, right?

[00:11:07]  
So what do I mean by that? Well, for example, have separate forms, so if you've got a landing page for charities, you'll have a separate landing page for higher education, a separate landing page for whatever else. Heritage, whatever sectors, and so each one is gonna have its own different landing page and you can tag people based on which landing pages you know which sector they're from.

[00:11:33]  
So that allows you to kind of segment your audience, the other ways you can just ask people. As I said earlier, on my own signup form, I actually have a drop down list that says, do you work in house? Do you work as part of an agency or are you a freelancer?

[00:11:49]  
Because I tend to customize my content a little bit around those different audiences. And the final thing I do is I actually watch people not in a creepy stalkiry way, but I will know what they've clicked on, for example in an email. So what I can do is based on what they click on, I will tag them with different subjects.

[00:12:10]  
So if they're always looking at design content, then I tagged them as probably being designers and they might get some customized content more specific to them. In terms of how you actually then customize their experience, how is it different? Well, it's a couple of different ways, one is they get different on boarding.

[00:12:31]  
So for example, that the email course that somebody from charities receives will be different from the email course, that somebody from higher education receives. But also I will vary my emails every once in a while as well, so basically that the emails might get tailored based on their different interests or segmentations.

[00:12:54]  
You could do that really easily with an if statement [LAUGH] basically in Convert Kit, so this statement says if you know a designer then write this, if it's anyone else they get this. So it's a really kind of easy way of just being able to tailor those emails just a little bit, normally it's only one or two paragraphs is different and they're basically the same other than that.

[00:13:18]  
So that's it really, that's how you grow your list, if you're feeling super enthusiastic, you could take your marketing to the next level. But this is for further down the line, but I'll just throw it in here anyway to give you something to aim towards in the future.

[00:13:33]  
First thing I would say is get organized, dedicate regular time to marketing and get better at tracking what works and what doesn't. Start using a B testing, which I think you mentioned at one point, an experiment to monitor the results and things like that, in terms of dedicated time.

[00:13:50]  
I'm now at the position, you can get yourself into a virtuous cycle if you get it right, so the more time you spend marketing the more people you attract the higher your rates you can charge. Because you only need to convert a small percentage of them, which means the higher your rates are, the less hours you have to do with chargeable clients.

[00:14:15]  
Which allows more time for marketing and you go round and round in circles, so my for example, I'm in a situation now where my business is based on me charging out phony 50% of my time. So that means the other 50% time, I can either use for doing boring admin stuff, for marketing, or sitting around on the beach if I really want to, but I tend to just pump it more into marketing.

[00:14:44]  
Be more ambitious work on bigger projects, eventually if you can churn out a few of these reports and you're feeling more confident in your writing, you might wanna look at books. You might wanna look at video courses or workshops, these are really good at raising your profile because they've got higher barrier to entry, right?

[00:15:03]  
They're harder to do, fewer people do them, therefore they're considered more valuable, and then price higher, right? As you see more work don't necessarily just start hiring more people, which is what everybody instinctively wants to do. Instead raise your prices instead, that allows more time for marketing and leads to that virtuous cycle I was talking about.

[00:15:26]  
So let's do a quick summary of that and then we'll take our last break before we are done. So growing your audience, your checklist for this, includes setting aside regular time to focus on marketing, so you're putting out your marketing material regularly, Friday afternoons. Let's go to one with me, keep a list of possible topics that you can write about, so that you're not starting from a blank sheet every time.

[00:15:49]  
Don't be afraid to be yourself in your emails, you are an amazing precious snowflake that's got something unique to bring to the world. And I say that dripping with irony but at the same time I do totally mean it from a marketing point of view. Experiment to find the best way of adding more people to your list some things will work better than others and don't be afraid to dump something if it doesn't work.

[00:16:14]  
I'd podcast for 16 years and then went, no, this isn't working anymore and stopped, right? Create a way for your audience to start talking to one another and sharing, and consider alternatives and be more ambitious in your marketing approach as you gain more confidence.

##### Handling Leads

[00:00:00]  
>> So here we are, at the very last section of the day, really, the critical one, [LAUGH] right? We've gone to all this effort to build a mailing list, to nurture the relationships with people to hang on, keeping them engaged until they're ready to buy. And the moment finally comes when they email you.

[00:00:22]  
And they say, I've got a project, I've got something I wanna do with you. Now, first thing to say about this is this is gonna be an utterly different type of lead than any lead you have ever had before, because they know you. They've built a relationship with you.

[00:00:43]  
There is a rapport there already. You're not just another supplier. They know you're an expert. You're in a great position. They're gonna be more interested. The client has come to you because they're interested in working with you in particular, and that is a big deal. Secondly, they're more informed, all right?

[00:01:03]  
They have had weeks, months, maybe even years of you informing them about best practices, teaching them about the way you work, teaching them about your stuff. They know what they're gonna get. They know how you can help. They're really well informed. And finally, they're gonna be more open.

[00:01:20]  
The leads will come to you earlier so that decisions won't have already been made. And they're gonna be more open to hearing about your opinion of the best approach, because they're used to getting advice from you. So these are the perfect leads, all right? They're such a pleasure to work with, and people that come to you out of the blue.

[00:01:42]  
So you're gonna get people coming to you. But that last one, that one about them coming to you earlier does create a slight problem. Sometimes they come to you so early, right, that actually, there isn't a formal project in place yet. And so that lead needs to be nurtured and taken all the way through.

[00:02:05]  
So what that means is that we need to get organized with our leads, because a lead is gonna come to you earlier in the process. It may take a lot longer before it becomes a deal that can be closed. And so you need a system to manage that.

[00:02:19]  
You need a CRM, a Customer Relationship Management system. Now, this is normally the kind of thing that big organizations have, right? They have things like Salesforce, and all these big things. I'm not talking about anything like that, because obviously, that's not appropriate for us. But we need a CRM because we need a method of tracking every conversation that we have.

[00:02:45]  
Even if it's not an official request for proposal, and a way of nurturing those conversations all the way through to them being full blown projects, right? So that's why we need them. In terms of what we need that CRM to do, we need to be able to create some deals in it that are tied to individuals in an organization.

[00:03:07]  
Because you may have multiple deals with multiple people within the same organization. You need to be able to assign tasks and reminders to those deals for you to follow it up. You need to be able to add notes to remind you, because it may be a month, two months, six months between conversations.

[00:03:27]  
So you need the ability to add notes of where you're at with those deals. And you also need to be able to see all of those emails that you've ever had about that deal held in a central place. So not a lot then. So what do I use to achieve all of that?

[00:03:47]  
Well, personally, I use a tool called Pipedrive, okay? And Pipedrive is a really powerful tool that allows me to organize all of my different deals, see where they're at, be regularly prompted to follow them up and interact with them. And basically, you can organize it in a couple of ways.

[00:04:07]  
One is that you can organize your deals on how likely they are to come off. So whether they're almost signed, or whether they're just possible, or whatever else. And also, and this is a really useful view for me as an independent consultant, is I can see when they're likely to come off.

[00:04:27]  
So that I can start organizing my cash flow and organize my projects in terms of ensuring that I'm capable of delivering them, because I am just one person. So let's talk a little bit about using your CRM and making it a powerful tool to deal with these inquiries as they come in.

[00:04:48]  
First of all, every person who reaches out to you needs to go into your CRM, even if it's not a project. So every time someone from my mailing lists drops me an email, or anybody else drops me an email, they'll go into my CRM. Secondly, I will follow up on every conversation, even if it's just a question.

[00:05:09]  
So if somebody's dropped me an email say, in your last group email, you wrote about so and so, and so and so, I've got a question about it, can you help me, and I reply, right? That's not the end of the conversation, as far as I'm concerned. I will set a task to in a week, a month whatever I feel is appropriate to drop them a follow up and say did that advice help?

[00:05:38]  
How did it go? What turned out? Because often it's a question about, well, at my company, we've got this issue at the moment, right? So you follow up and say so how did that go? Did it help? So follow up questions. But probably the most important use of your CRM is to basically do something that my dad taught me.

[00:06:01]  
My dad works in sales, or did work in sales. And he gave me a piece of advice when I first started my business, which has been absolutely invaluable through my career, which is to pursue every lead to destruction. So what he meant by that is follow up every project, every inquiry until they say no, we don't wanna work with you, right?

[00:06:26]  
One of the biggest mistakes I see people make when they get an inquiry is they respond to it, and then don't follow it up. Instead, you need a way of consistently following up with somebody until they eventually say no, right? So how do I go about doing that, and how do I use my CRM for that?

[00:06:47]  
Well basically, let's say I've got an inquiry through, and I write a reply. A week later, I will get a reminder in Pipedrive, my CRM, to follow them up. So I'll drop them a follow up and say do you have any questions about what I said? How's it going?

[00:07:05]  
If I don't hear back from them, in two weeks, I'll drop them another email and go, I've just realized I never heard back from you, is everything all right? Are there any questions I can answer? I'm here to help. If I still don't hear back from them after four weeks, I'll drop them another email going, whatever happened to that conversation we were having, right?

[00:07:28]  
If I don't hear from them after 4 weeks, they'll get an email after 8, and then 16, and so on, forever and ever and ever and ever, right, until they say no. And you might think, wow, Paul, that's a bit hardcore. But it's paid off, because I've got a reason to keep going back to them.

[00:07:55]  
Now, oftentimes, they come back to me, obviously. Very rarely do I get beyond about eight weeks before somebody drops me a line. And then they'll say something like, we're not quite there yet, or this has got delayed to the next quarter, or whatever. And I say absolutely fine, completely understand, these things take time.

[00:08:14]  
I'll drop you an email next quarter, and so I add a reminder in to do that. So every email has to be carefully followed up. And you might think, well, are you banging against a closed door? Are you wasting your time? No, so often, these emails turn into something eventually, so often.

[00:08:37]  
And I often get emails back going you know what, Paul, I'm really grateful you kept pursuing this. It kept getting pushed down my list, and I never got around to it, but your emails reminded me, right? So don't be afraid, very rarely do you annoy people. And I often adopt a very apologetic tone in them as well.

[00:08:58]  
I'll say look, I don't wanna annoy you, but I don't wanna seem disinterested either. And it is about showing genuine interest in their project and what they're trying to do. Give them permission to tell you to stop. Say look, if I'm annoying you, just drop me an email, let me know.

[00:09:20]  
I don't wanna annoy you. But I don't wanna give up, because this looks like a really interesting project, and show an interest. Okay, so there's a bit about how I use my CRM. Let's talk a little bit about how to engage with a new lead when they first contact you.

[00:09:41]  
So somebody dropped you an email says I got this project that we're thinking about doing. Is this the kind of thing that you might be able to help with? I often get emails like, do you do this kind of thing? Because I've never come out explicitly and said these are the services I offer, but they still contact me anyway.

[00:10:03]  
So first of all, I'll arrange a call as soon as possible. Speaking to somebody over Zoom instantly builds a relationship that you just cannot build in the same way via email. So get them on a Zoom call, get them talking. I use a tool called Calendarly to let them book a meeting in themselves without that endless backwards and forwards over trying to arrange your time.

[00:10:26]  
Second, I try and understand their challenge. And on that call, I will help them in any way I can, right? So I'll let them pick my brain, I'll give them all the advice I can. I don't hold back anything. And some people do abuse that. Occasionally I get people that will basically ask for a call, have a load of advice, getting hours free consultancy from me, and I never hear from them again, right?

[00:10:53]  
But they're the minority, most people are pretty good. They don't like to abuse your time, and so I will give them as much advice as I can. I'm there to help. If they hire me, that's a bonus. They almost always do. Then I will actually on that call discuss budget, right?

[00:11:12]  
And the reason I discuss that is because I can very much tailor what I provide based on the budget they've got available. So I ask the client if they've got any budgetary constraints. If they say they don't, that's normally a lie. Not necessarily a conscious lie, it's just it's their way of saying I haven't thought about budget.

[00:11:34]  
But in truth, they've got constraints. So what I do is I start throwing around some numbers and gauge their reaction. So they'll say, we don't have a budget. And I say, so if I came back with a million and a half project, you're happy with that? No [SOUND], 50,000?

[00:11:52]  
No, we could probably do 50,000. What about 100,000? [SOUND] And so you're beginning to kinda narrow it down and just have a frank conversation about it. And the way I do is I say it's a bit like buying a house, right? The first thing an estate agent is gonna ask you, or real estate, or whatever you call them, is how much can you afford to spend?

[00:12:14]  
Because even if you say you want a three bedroom house that's detached in a nice area, well, okay, then. But the price could still will vary wildly depending on what other facilities it's got, what condition it's in, etc. So without a budget, you've got no framework within which to work to suggest a good solution.

[00:12:38]  
So I always discuss budget up front. The other thing I'd say is don't be afraid to challenge in these conversations. If a client comes to you saying they want a mobile app, and you think that's a terrible idea, tell them it's. Well, don't tell them it's a terrible idea.

[00:12:52]  
But say, well, have you considered doing this instead? If you disagree with their suggestions, it's okay to say so. Be a peer and an advisor, not a supplier, right? And the reason you can get away with that is because you've been their peer and advisor for weeks, or months, or years, as they've read your stuff, all right?

[00:13:15]  
They want you to come up with ideas. They're expecting the same from you that they've been reading. So that's how I go about engaging with leads as they come in.

##### Create a Proposal

Let's talk about proposals, right? Cuz I really wanna give you as much as I can about how I do it. Whether that's always gonna be suited to you and your situation, I don't know. First thing to say is in many cases, the proposal for me is gonna be a formality.

[00:00:17]  
The client has already decided they want to work with me before they even contacted me. And, I've discussed budget, I've discussed scope. It's all been agreed and that the proposal really is a matter of me writing that all down so that it's in a written format. However that said, I do make an effort with my proposals simply because I know other people might read them, right?

[00:00:44]  
So I'm actually gonna show you what I include in my proposals cuz one of the weird things is that everybody seems to be really secretive about this stuff. And it's like that's his secret sauce that winds and work. And it's like you never get to see other people's proposals so what the heck, let's do it.

[00:01:01]  
So this is the, I use a tool called qwiil, qwiil.com. I think I might have a link in here somewhere. And I like it because you've got templates. And you can just fill in the template, and it does it a lot faster. So yeah, basically the first section in my proposals is called engagement evaluation.

[00:01:26]  
And I just start by explaining the need that they have for my help, why they want me. I avoid talking about the company because they already know who they are, so many people start their proposals, so and so is a SME in the retail sector. Well, they know that, why are you telling them that.

[00:01:45]  
But to repeat back to them why they need to hire you, well, that's a whole another ball game. The second section I have is objectives, where I outline a small number of objectives that the project should deliver. For example, one objective might be to increase the number of leads.

[00:02:01]  
So that really focuses people on the benefits that working with me will provide, because those are the objectives they're trying to reach. Then we've got measures of success. By the way, these blue bits in between their testimonials from various clients. They're always good to put in, especially if they're big names, it always helps.

[00:02:19]  
Anyway, measures of success. So for each of my objectives, we need a way of knowing whether those objectives have been achieved or not. So I write down some how we're gonna measure success, and that reassures the client and sets you up for more work when you can actually demonstrate success.

[00:02:38]  
When you go back at the end of the project, and go look, we agreed with these, I've delivered all of these, then they're more likely to hire you again. So I include that in there. Next section is the value. Now a lot of people skip over this, the value to the company.

[00:02:51]  
For each of my objectives, I attempt to tie it to a tangible, ideally monetary return, right? Doing this makes your price look a lot more reasonable. Now we go into a conversation about pricing over lunch, and the subject value brace pricing came up. This idea of your fee is related to the benefit that it provides.

[00:03:18]  
It's a really tricky one to do. And in most cases, for the type of work I do at least, I haven't been able to make it work. But what I have taken away from value-based pricing is this idea of showing the value that you are going to be providing ideally in monetary terms, so I do that.

[00:03:41]  
Then we get into the methodology. Now, so this is more what I'm gonna do, but I always create options for people, right? I always try and offer a client multiple options, so normally it's three. And basically there's one that is going to come in just under their budget, right, so whatever we agreed the budget should be.

[00:04:07]  
Then we're gonna do a second one that's slightly higher than their budget, with a few extra bells and whistles that are appropriate. And then the third one, I totally ignored their budget and just spec it up as if I was doing it as good as I possibly could, right?

[00:04:23]  
Amazing, it's amazing how many times they end up picking the deluxe version, right? If you always stick within their budget that the client has said, you're throwing away good work, basically. And you're not always giving the client the best solution either because you're having to stick within the budget they've given you.

[00:04:46]  
Then after that, I get into basically how great I am. So I have a section that outlines the benefits you in particular provide. So define both why you're a right fit, but also why you're not. Now that may seem a strange thing to do. So just to give you a snippet of how I do that, I say at the end, ultimately whether you hire me comes down to your ambitions for digital.

[00:05:14]  
If you consider digital key to your long-term business success, I'm probably the right choice. However, if it is seen as an important but secondary component, there may be better and cheaper suppliers, right? So I'm positioning myself in a very particular place in the market. And I begin that section by saying I'm not the cheapest option there, right?

[00:05:38]  
So don't be afraid to exclude yourself sometimes because actually saying what you're not reinforces what your others aren't. Sounds like that's kicked off something in the chatroom, doesn't surprise me, often creates a reaction. Yeah, what you got Mark?  
>> Does the deluxe version cost a lot less or bit less than the value to the company?

[00:06:02]  
>> The deluxe version, the value to the company, I don't even try and tie it to the value of the company, right? As I'd say over lunch, I think am getting myself in such trouble with the people that promote value-based pricing. And I've got a good friend, Jonathan Stock, who really pushes value based pricing.

[00:06:26]  
And to his credit, has made it work really well for himself. So I don't know what he's doing that I'm not. But I haven't managed to get value-based pricing to feel like I'm not just ripping people off. And I understand in principle of tying the value you provide to the value that you, sorry, the value that you charge to the value you create.

[00:06:52]  
I do I understand that in principle. But, you can't make the guarantees that you will provide the value that you say you'll provide. I think it's very hard in most situations to do that. So I don't tend to work in that way. So my deluxe version really is just priced at whatever I think the right way of doing this project is.

[00:07:16]  
And I just basically, no budget is a constraint. Now it may work out. I mean, obviously, I don't ever allow that figure to go over the potential value that I think I can bring in, otherwise it's not the right solution, is it? If it's gonna lose the company money, then it can't possibly be the right solution for them.

[00:07:36]  
So it will come under that figure, but it may not come under it by a lot, at least in the first year. It may even make a slight loss in the first year, but then over subsequent years it'll make it up. So yeah, I don't tie it that closely or pay that much attention.

[00:07:53]  
But that's just me, I mean, there are other ways of doing this stuff. Okay, then I get into logistics, how long is it gonna take? Who's gonna do it? What's the role of both myself and the client? All of that kind of stuff. And then actually, because I use this app called Quiller, allows me to create an interactive pricing table that lets people pick whatever option they want, lets them change certain criteria.

[00:08:20]  
So for example, I often do usability testing, and they can change the number of people I do testing with to adjust the price. They get it all right as they want it, they click the Accept button, and then they can actually sign there and then within the app.

[00:08:35]  
I don't always do it that way. Because for example, when I'm working with very large organizations, they all have their own T's and C's. They have their own procurement policies and all the rest of that, and so my T's and C's almost always get rejected in that situation.

[00:08:50]  
But where I can, I do it all within the app. So that's my proposals and kinda gives you a sense of those. Now there's one thing that, I don't know whether you've spotted it, but there's something that's been missing from my process here. Something that is very normal and normally appears but hasn't, and that's pitching.

[00:09:14]  
I don't pitch, okay? And I think if you can build the process that I've talked about here, and if you can get through all of the, if you can build up that audience, if you can nurture that audience, if you can handle them right as they come in, then you're not gonna have to pitch for work, right?

[00:09:35]  
Because the client will already know they want to work with you. And occasionally, there was a period of time when I would do the occasional pitch because the company had said so, we've got to procurement and yeah, I'm sorry we have to do a pitch. I mean, I'd only ever do them if they basically turned around and said yeah, we are gonna go with you but we have to jump through the hoops.

[00:10:05]  
These days I'm very fortunate, and I'm actually at the point where I say, look, if you're going out to tender, I'm not taking part in this. Even if you turn around to me and say we want you, cuz I think that's unfair to the other people that have been played along, right?

[00:10:23]  
So I don't play in that game at all now but I fully recognize that's only because I'm now in a privileged position. But what you will find is that the amount of pitching you have to do considerably drops off, because people are coming to work with you, you're not just another supplier.

[00:10:43]  
So really that's all I wanted to say on that. I do wanna leave you with that checklist. I'm doing a checklist at the end of each of the sections. So most of my checklist for turning leads into projects. Get yourself a CRM to track every lead that comes in, you won't regret it.

[00:10:58]  
It's a little bit money but it's a business expense well-worth paying. Pursue every lead to destruction, don't give up people, keep going. Arrange a call with any lead as soon as possible, get them on the phone, get them on Zoom. It makes a huge difference to building the relationship.

[00:11:16]  
When talking to a client act like an advisor not as a supplier. They've been used to you being advising them and giving them advice, they want you to carry on doing that. They don't want you to suddenly turn into, I don't know, one of the servants in Downton Abbey going yes sir, no sir, whatever you want sir.

[00:11:34]  
Be that advisor they've come to expect. Ensure your proposals demonstrate value, the value that you're going to bring. And offered lots of different options, at least when three is about right actually, never offer a single option because there's always opportunities to upsell. So I've hit you with a lot of stuff in this workshop, and there are a lot of steps involved and it's gonna take you time to process all of that.

[00:12:05]  
But just as you go away from today, I wanna try and leave you with just the basic next steps, right? You can come back and go over this material as many times as you need to. I suggest you come back to it as you're going through it. So watch each section as you're implementing it, but just to give you the next steps to get you going.

[00:12:26]  
Step one, decide on who you wanna work with, that's all you got to do to begin with. Step two, work on that survey so that you can better understand those people and what they need, the problems that they're facing, etc. And make contact with them by doing that.

[00:12:43]  
Then you wanna build that landing page with the associated email course and you'll report to encourage more sign ups. And then you wanna nurture the relationships over time via email. And get organized with how you deal with those incoming leads.

#### Wrapping up

[00:00:00]  
>> Time for call to action, isn't it? Time for me to have my signup form. So you can download the slides and you don't need to sign up to anything to do this. Go download the slides at subscribe.boagworld.com/findclients. If you wanna sign up for my newsletter as well, you know exactly what you're gonna get by this stage [LAUGH] of things but that's entirely up to you.

[00:00:23]  
The slides have got all of the information we've talked about, they've got links in it. And I really wanna emphasize that at any stage even if you're watching this four five years from now, if you've got a question, drop me an email, my email address is in the slide so every question there's a link to my email address.

[00:00:42]  
I'm more than happy to answer questions because I know how much anxiety finding clients and keeping work coming in can be. And to be honest, I've had moments in my life where it's really damaged my mental health and I don't wanna see anybody else in that position and if I can help, I honestly will.

[00:01:02]  
Talking of questions, we got any final questions before we wrap up for today, I would love to deal with them now if you've got them.  
>> Are there any thoughts whether freelancers should do their website on a domain named after themselves or after their own company?  
>> Yeah, I'm probably the worst person in the world to ask this question from.

[00:01:28]  
Yeah, inadvertently I've managed to build a brand name on Boagworld. How egotistical does that sound, right? How did that happen? That was such a mess up. It was supposed to be just a personal site and it kind of escalated and before I knew it, now it's my brand name.

[00:01:49]  
Well, here's the thing, it depends on your aspirations. If you intend to build an agency one day, if you tend to take on multiple employees then you might wanna consider one that's not around your name. The one thing that you should definitely, definitely not do is to pretend to be something you're not, right?

[00:02:10]  
And what do I mean by that? I despise with a passion freelancers who use the word we, right? When it's just one person, okay? There is this perception that to attract big clients you need to be a big agency and that is complete BS, right? I work with UNICEF, I work with European Commission, I work with PUMA, I work with Shell, all of these massive companies and it's just me on my tod, all right?

[00:02:45]  
That has nothing to do with it. If you are a single person, an independent freelancer or consultant just like I am, be honest, there's no shame in that, in fact there's a lot of benefits to being that, okay? For a start, one of the things that companies hate is they hire an agency and they end up with the billy staff, right?

[00:03:09]  
When they hire you, they get you and that's a great selling point. Whether or not that domain name is your name or not, that doesn't really matter, that's a toss up whatever you fancy. I think if you're intending maybe to one day grow into an agency, it's probably better to avoid it.

[00:03:25]  
But on the other hand, it's quite nice, it's quite personal if it's your own name. So I haven't really answered the question but hopefully there's a few thoughts in there worth having. Any others come out?  
>> Do you ever find that maybe getting work or having a job disrupts the process of making a survey or a report or extrapolating out of those to get your content?

[00:03:49]  
>> Yeah.  
>> How do you manage those?  
>> That's a really good question cuz yes, it would. Yeah, it does. So it's a tricky one because there are certain things that you can leave gaps between and there's certain things you can't. Once you've first reached out to your audience, that cold list, you have to move relatively quickly to delivering the report because otherwise they go cold, right?

[00:04:19]  
So your first email needs to go out then maybe two weeks later, the survey needs to go out and then maybe a month later, the report needs to be there. So in that period of time, you really need to pick a period where you know you're gonna be free and gonna be able to do this, right?

[00:04:38]  
So that might be that you book it out from client work which I know is really hard to turn away. Maybe it's you take a holiday for that length of time, maybe it's you pick a time where you know it's gonna be nothing much goes on, whatever, but that bit you can't really split up.

[00:04:57]  
Everything else really can be fitted around normal client work cuz after that you're talking about guest posts, you're talking about interviews, these are just one of little things that can be done whenever. And you can grow your list at whatever speed you can afford to do. The only thing that obviously needs to be set is your email to go out every fortnight or every month, wherever is possible.

[00:05:22]  
So it's just that first bit that really you can't let client work get in the way of, which I haven't found a way around that yet but it is a weakness because I know that's hard to do.  
>> Have you thought about doing outsourcing because you are outsourcing by using these tools that you have in a sense.

[00:05:45]  
>> Yeah.  
>> Have you thought about actually having a list of other freelancers that you reach out to do some of your, could be even just maintaining these things that you do like tracking, analyzing your surveys and-.  
>> Yeah, there's quite a lot of opportunities if you wanted to go down that route.

[00:06:04]  
I'm a bit of a control freak and also I'm fortunate that I've got enough space in my business to be able to do it myself. For a start, all that boring research at the beginning of making the list of companies and influencers and all that kind of stuff, I have been known to get my wife to do that.

[00:06:26]  
She kind of volunteered [LAUGH], so I guess I outsourced that a little bit, that's a great one, anybody could do that, you could get student doing that. Equally getting email addresses and all that kind of stuff. Any contact with the client I wouldn't outsource or people in the list so your emails, your newsletters, all that kind of stuff.

[00:06:46]  
Landing page, you could outsource that if you wanted to. If you're not a good designer it makes sense to do that. Your kind of analytics, maybe you could do that. Social media updates, getting someone to take content from your report and turn it in social media updates, you can outsource that.

[00:07:04]  
So yeah, absolutely, if you wanna go down that route. I just think it depends on how much cash you've got to do that kind of thing. A lot of freelancers are a bit tight on their cash flow and so don't really wanna do that but an agency certainly could.

[00:07:22]  
So yeah, it's an option. Any more questions from chat or should we call it a day?  
>> Any advice to younger freelancers or advice you would give yourself earlier in your career?  
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I get asked this question all the time. And I was kinda talking about this earlier because I'm actually the worst person to ask that question of cuz I started in my career in 1994, right?

[00:07:56]  
So any experiences that I learned then are definitely not relevant today. Unlike anything I know now, I'm so skewed by all my years of experience and my well established business at the moment that actually my advice for a freelancer probably isn't particularly useful for a young freelancer. I will give the same advice that I gave earlier, I think it was in a break or over lunch which is that, if you are just starting out, right?

[00:08:29]  
Maybe you've just done a boot camp or you're very early on in your career. My advice is not to jump straight into freelancing, right? My advice is first of all, spend even just a year working for an agency and see how they do things even if they're a terrible agency, right?

[00:08:46]  
You will learn loads about how not to do it and you'll get exposed to these kinds of soft skills and the kind of stuff that you don't think about when you set up a freelance business. You just think, well, I can build a website so I can run a freelance business.

[00:09:04]  
Yeah, but can you sell yourself? Can you deal with clients? Can you do project management? Can you do finances, right? That took me by surprise [LAUGH]. How complicated that was when I went by myself cuz when I ran an agency I had a partner that dealt with all of that and so that came as a real shock to me.

[00:09:22]  
So take a bit of time in an agency before jumping into freelance, that's really the only advice I can give. I guess another piece of advice I'd give myself is, don't spend too much time learning the latest framework or the latest design tool or the latest whatever, they come and go really fast, right?

[00:09:48]  
What doesn't change is people. People are always the same. So spend your time, I'm not saying don't learn the technology, of course you've gotta learn technology and Frontend Masters is an excellent source of advice on all the technology you could ever want to learn. But in addition to learning that stuff, don't forget to learn the soft skills, don't forget to learn how to deal with clients, how to build relationships with colleagues, all of those things.

[00:10:20]  
Those are the things that last and don't change. Technology will come and go. So yeah, just bear that in mind.  
>> I feel like sharing my own experience.  
>> Go for it, yeah, do it.  
>> [INAUDIBLE] this. In the early stages, I always worked for pennies on the dollar just to get experience.

[00:10:40]  
>> Yeah.  
>> And so I did a ton of websites for cheap under selling myself. However when I did get a full time job again, I was underpaid but I did learn a lot at an agency building a lot of things.  
>> Yeah.  
>> And then to take the leap what I did was, I got a 20-hour week contract.

[00:11:02]  
>> Yeah.  
>> That would essentially cover my living expenses.  
>> Yeah.  
>> And then from there I would try to get the high paying work which I eventually replaced that 20 hours a week with.  
>> Yeah.  
>> Once that was up and I had more work flowing then I was continually kind of like climbing that ladder of increasing my rate, getting better and better projects and no longer under selling myself.

[00:11:33]  
But it took a lot of work in the early stages to get the reputation and the skills to be able to manage even at kind of a lower where we were getting paid $10 an hour or peanuts or whatever.  
>> Yeah.  
>> For a long time but anyways.

[00:11:48]  
>> That idea of of taking a 20-hour contract, so don't jump into freelancing with both feet overnight cuz that's terrifying. But actually to do it more gradually I think it's excellent advice, totally agree with that. I think on those words of wisdom from Mark, we should finish simply.

[00:12:06]  
Thank very much for watching this course. Hope you found it useful and good luck with your future career and direction.  
>> [APPLAUSE]
