> [!tip] there is one main reason why so many of you are struggling to land your first web design client and that is ==trust==.


people and businesses don't want to give you money or even get a free website from you.\
not because your services are bad. But because, they don't trust you and why would they?ðŸ¥ 

==you're a stranger trying to sell them on the phone via email/DM==


why will they trust you?\
if you can't show past client work and results\
or, if you're not giving any free value to them.
