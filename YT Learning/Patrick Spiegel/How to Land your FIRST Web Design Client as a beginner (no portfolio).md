Â 
> [!tip] there is one main reason why so many of you are struggling to land your first web design client and that is **trust**.


people and businesses don't want to give you money or even get a free website from you.\
not because your services ==are bad==. But because, they don't trust you and why would they?ðŸ˜€

you're a stranger trying to sell them on the phone via email/DM.

why will they trust you?\
if you can't show past client work and results\
or, if you're not giving any free value to them.
