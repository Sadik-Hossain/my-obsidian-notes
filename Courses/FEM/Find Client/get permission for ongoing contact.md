## why ongoing communication matters 

Our survey and report may have got us on our audience's radar, but we need to stay there and continue to build credibility in the minds of our audience.

We need to be able to show them how great we are, okay? Then you can tell somebody, yeah, I'm an amazing developer, I do all this great work or whatever. But that is not as valuable as them discovering that from sales based on what they've learned about you, what they've heard about you, what they've read, that you've said, those kinds of things.

>[!tip] stay front and center in people's minds 
>it's essential, that we stay front and center in people's minds\
>so that, when they need our services, we're instantly their preferred supplier.

So it's those two things that we need to stay front and center in the minds, **we need to build credibility**. And that's where regular contact via email can provide that.

That's why on my website, at the bottom of every single page, you've got a call to action to sign up to my mailing list, cuz once I've got you on my mailing list, I've gotcha. That's it, you are at my mercy. 

**how do we gain the permission that we need?**

***Promote the report***\
the number one thing that we wanna do is we wanna promote the report.\
So we're gonna contact our audience and tell them about the report. And we're also gonna reach out to those influencers

***provide an email course***\
In addition to that, alongside the report, we probably want to offer a short email course that dives a little bit deeper into the issues that are found in the report. \
Its not extra work. It's regurgitating what's in the report and adding a bit more detail.

so you've downloaded the report. Now, you get these kind of series of introductory emails. And then once you've had that emails, then you're going on to that ongoing advice.

***Provide ongoing advice***\
So after people finish the course, they will continue to hear from you via monthly emails forever or bi-weekly or whatever you decide to do.

So really, the report is done, that's your upfront work, piece of work done. Then we're gonna put together a short email course that only ever needs to be done once.

And then when people sign up, they're gonna get those over a series of weeks. So once you've done all of that, then really, your kind of week to week marketing is literally just doing those ongoing newsletters
