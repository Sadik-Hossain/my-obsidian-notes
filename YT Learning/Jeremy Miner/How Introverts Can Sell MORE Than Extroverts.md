##### Tonality & Verbal Cues
---
when you gain the tonality and the pacing of what you're saying, it becomes more natural in how you're communicating with someone.

when you start learning verbal cues.

it sounds natural, that causes your prospects to keep their guard down and they open up emotionally.

that's a big Game Changer. it just becomes like you're flowing with the conversation instead of pushing the conversation.

**Verbal pacing & Verbal Pauses**  

by using Verbal pauses, our brain cannot help but to internalize and think really deep about that question and that gets more of a openness. 

so the prospect things deep, they're more open and they really like think about it, internalize it and they start to build a gap (where they are & where they wanna be)

because, now they emotionally open up. whereas, verbal pacing is like asking questions so fast, they stay surface level with you.


##### Posturing & Being Observant
---
having a calm, confidence and to become more assertive.

because, assertiveness doesn't mean that you're like in their face. when you come across assertive it's Collective, it's calm.

it's people view you as an expert. because you're calm. so even if a prospect gets upset and throws out a huge objection it has no impact on you emotionally.

and you view it as more not their fault, but like you're starting to think like:<br>
- oh, what did I say?<br>
- how did I use my tone that triggered him or her to react that way?

know & clarify what's behind their objection or concern.

and then how to reframe them and help them overcome that concern. where they become on your side.

became more observant and aware and more in control of yourself and more control of the conversation.

that's not that Its manipulating someone, but just guiding and observing and also bringing things to attention.

you became more of a facilitator.

**you're helping the prospect understand what their real situation is.**<br> because, most don't when you first start talking to them.

maybe they know they have a problem. But,

- they don't know how bad the problem is really
- or maybe they don't understand the consequences of what happens, if they don't do anything about solving the problem.

learn to become more open and curious and just paying attention more to what they say, rather than just knowing where the conversation is going.

 It's one thing to be interesting, but it's a different thing to be interested.<br>
 **So be genuinely interested.**

##### Overcome Your Ego
---
the biggest thing that holds most sales back from greatness is, they have such a high ego.

because they're doing good that, they think they know everything there is to know about selling and that's why unfortunately for them, they stay at the same income.

they get into the ego world of saying, you know I don't need the help, I can do this.

there's a difference between confidence and arrogance.

and the question comes is:
<br>**who do you serve?**
 
 ask yourself, who are you really serving?<br>
 are you serving yourself or serving the people that you're selling to?<br>
 do you really care about you or care about them?
 
 it's a little bit of both. <br>
 but, at the end of the day, what it really came down to is,  you really care about the people around you.
 
every time you hit a new level, you're always thinking, you're always presented that ability to say this is it, I've arrived to know everything.

and that's the thing you have to eliminate.

you don't know it all and you've never arrived, so you got to stay hungry and stay curious and keep on learning.

and that's how you also adapt even in your own industry and like learning new questions and new ways of saying things.


##### A note on body language
---
Â if you're not doing calls on Zoom you're not fully communicating at like impactful.
because, they can't visually see, they don't trust you as much and it's a disadvantage for you <br>
because, you can't read their body language.

So, try as much possible to do video call, video record etc. Focus on your tonality, hand gestures, visualizing with hand, facial expression of concerns/confusion etc.


##### how would you frame a consequence question
---
how would you frame a consequence question to a very wealthy customer and regular middle class customer.

typically if somebody's wealthy, what I want to do is I want to push them away a little bit.

**I want to push them away and get them to defend themselves on why they're maybe looking to change.** because, that pulls me back in, they pull me back in.

see, **a wealthy person does not want to be forced to do anything**, most people don't want to be forced to keep paying the rate hikes.

example:<br>
lets say, you're selling to solar industry,
```
So, why look at this now? (why you're thinking for a change)
why not push it down the road, & keep being forced to pay the rate hikes, like a lot of ppl who doesn't know anything about solar.
```

see, **they don't want to be like** a lot of people do who don't know anything about solar, because now they know about solar, because you've been talking to them about it. <br>
>*(we are making them feel considered person, making them thinking to act smart by {showing/saying/suggesting} what {unsmarts/inconsiderate/common} people are doing, what consequence it can have).*

consequence question will only work if they're wealthy and they've kind of started opening up a little bit about looking at solar.

if they're completely emotionally shut down, you can't ask it that way.
it wouldn't make any sense.


`why look at doing this now?`<br>
if they're like, "well, I'm not looking at doing this now." that wouldn't make any sense. so if you have a type that's not opened up at all

you might want to / can like lean down and in a concern tone.

you can be like,

"do you want to keep me or do you want to keep being forced to pay the rate hikes, **if you didn't have to.**"

see that's a different angle of that we would teach you, do you want to keep
being forced to pay the rate hikes, **if you didn't have to.**

see, that's a confused concerned tone. I even put my hand on my chest that's a body language signal that indicates,

I'm concerned for you, I'm concerned for your problem and your situation and the consequence.

<b><u>what does that do in the prospect's mind, when you use a concern tone with that type of question?</u></b>

It shows, I really care about the person and also you're becoming a part of their Journey at the same time. <br> so, it's not that I'm like trying to like convince them, I'm **trying to bring an awakening question inside of their mind, where they become self-aware.**


##### Bringing self-awareness to you & your prospect
---
In today's day & age, people aren't taught to think, they're only taught to react.

Self-awareness is the greatest level of success, the more you become self-aware & the more that you **help them become self-aware**, the faster it gets them out of reaction mode to thinking mode.

And that thinking mode & feeling mode is where they make that decision.
