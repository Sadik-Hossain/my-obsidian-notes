> [!quote] The internet is noisy, and your marketing will be lost unless targeted at a specific audience. In this section, we will explore how to do precisely that.


we have to decide,\
who do we wanna work with?\
who we wanna market to?

## Why you need to segment your market? / why its important to specialize

**Less Competition**\
The more specialized you are, the fewer others can offer what you offer. That means, less competition & less pitching for work.

**Seen as an expert**\
by specializing in your area, you're seen as an expert in your particular field. You become the "goto" person for that work.

 **Higher fees**\
Because, fewer people can do what you do to the same standard, you can charge more.


==Specialty in terms of the group that we are reaching out to.==\
we are not talking about specializing in wordpress or tech stack.\
we are talking about the type of audience we wanna serve/help/reach. (ex: charitable website)

Specializing mean,
- **tailoring our msg**\
	because, we are focusing on a **specific audience**, we can tailor the messaging to **better resonate** with them. We can talk about their pain points, their issues, their problems
- **Being heard more often**\
	as you are constantly targeting the same grp of ppl, they will hear from you more often & come to know your name.
- **Become the go-to person**\
	as you demonstrate an understanding of your audience's challenges, you will become seen as the go-to person for that sector.

we will create a separate campaign with a landing page, **aimed at the type of audience you are trying to reach.**


> [!danger] Stop redesigning your website every 5mins, it will not help
> Your failure to win new work is not because of your website.\
> Its because, you are not targeting the right audience and providing them with value regularly.


## How to find minimum viable audience

This is the smallest group of people we can find, that is capable of generating of enough work to keep us busy for 2-3 yrs.

This audience has to have to certain characteristics for this work well.\


### they Boost or amplify your voice

There are some sectors/ groups of people has a strong sense of community.\
they communicate with each other (ex: developers). They share a lot, they talk to one another, they interact with eachother. In there, anything you put out there are more likely to get handed around the sector and get promoted.

There are other sectors who are highly competitive with one another. They dont talk to another, in those you are not gonna get the same amplification. 

**so, we wanna work for sectors, that have a lil bit of community in it.**

**Can they afford you?**\
before worrying about anything else, you need to establish whether they can afford your service or the size of client you wish to target.

**Do they move around?**\
How long do people stay in a company? If they regularly move on within the same sector, your reputation will move on with them.

**Do they talk to one another?**\
some sectors are very protective of their intellectual property, so there is little communication between companies, others are very open, you want the latter.

**Is there a community**\
Does the sector have dedicated blogs, mailing list, conferences, and online communities? These are excellent forums for you to reach members of your target audience. Sector where community assemble. 


**Are there influencers in the community?**\
Are their figures within the community who are already well known and respected? Do they seem approachable and friendly?

become a big part of the community just by joining in and offering help/advice.
