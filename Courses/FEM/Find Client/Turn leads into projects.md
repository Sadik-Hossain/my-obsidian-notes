## Handling a different kind of lead

We've gone to all this effort to build a mailing list, to nurture the relationships with people keeping them engaged, until they're ready to buy. 

And the moment finally comes when they email you.

And they say, I've got a project, I've got something I wanna do with you. 
Now, first thing to say about this is this is gonna be an utterly different type of lead than any lead you have ever had before.

because they know you. They've built a relationship with you.\
There is a rapport there already. You're not just another supplier. They know you're an expert. You're in a great position. 

***More interested***\
The client has come to you because they're interested in working with you in particular.

***More informed***\
They have had weeks, months, maybe even years of you informing them about best practices & your way of working. 

They are better educated.\
They know what they're gonna get. They know how you can help. They're really well informed.

***More open***\
And finally, they're gonna be more open.

The leads will come to you earlier so that decisions won't have already been made. And they're gonna be more open to hearing about your opinion of the best approach.\
because they're used to getting advice from you. 



Sometimes they come to you so early that actually there isn't a formal project in place yet. And so that lead needs to be nurtured and taken all the way through.

So what that means is that we need to get organized with our leads\


## Get organized with your leads

because a lead is gonna come to you earlier in the process. It may take a lot longer before it becomes a deal that can be closed. And so you need a system to manage that.

**You need a CRM**

>[!example]- why?
> we need a method of tracking every conversation that we have.
> 
> Even if it's not an official request for proposal, and a way of nurturing those conversations all the way through to them being full blown projects

> [!example]- what for?
> - we need to be able to create some deals in it that are tied to individuals in an organization.
> - You need to be able to assign tasks and reminders to those deals for you to follow it up. 
> - You need to be able to add notes to remind you, because it may be a month, two months, six months between conversations.
> - you also need to be able to see all of those emails that you've ever had about that deal held in a central place.



**using your CRM**
- ***First of all, every person who reaches out to you needs to go into your CRM, even if it's not a project.***\
	So every time someone from my mailing lists drops me an email, or anybody else drops me an email, they'll go into my CRM. 

***
- ***follow up on every conversation, even if it's just a question.***\
	So if somebody's dropped an email say, in your last group email, you wrote about so and so, and so and so, I've got a question about it, can you help me, and I reply
	
	set a task to in a week, a month whatever feels appropriate to drop them a follow up and say did that advice help? How did it go? What turned out? 
	
	Because often it's a question about, well, at my company, we've got this issue at the moment, So you follow up and say, so how did that go? Did it help? So follow up questions.
	

---

- ***follow up on every project enquiry to destruction***

>[!tip] pursue every lead to destruction. 
>So what he meant by that is follow up every project, every inquiry until they say "no, we don't wanna work with you." 


>[!quote] One of the biggest mistakes people make when they get an inquiry is they respond to it, and then don't follow it up. 
>Instead, you need a way of consistently following up with somebody until they eventually say no!

---

- ***contact in a week, two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks & so on***\
	let's say I've got an inquiry through, and I write a reply.\
	A week later,\
	I will get a reminder in Pipedrive, to follow them up. So I'll drop them a follow up and say,\
	do you have any questions about what I said? How's it going?
	
	If I don't hear back from them, in two weeks,\
	I'll drop them another email and go, I've just realized I never heard back from you, is everything all good?\ 
	or, Are there any questions I can answer? I'm here to help. 
	
	If I still don't hear back from them after four weeks,\
	I'll drop them another email going, whatever happened to that  conversation we were having.
	
	If I don't hear from them after 4 weeks, they'll get an email after 8, 
	and then 16, and so on, forever and ever and ever and ever, until  they say no.
	
	And you might think, wow, Paul, that's a bit hardcore. But it's paid off, because I've got a reason to keep going back to them.
	
	Now, oftentimes, they come back to me. Very rarely do I get beyond about eight weeks before somebody drops me a line.\
	And then they'll say something like,\
	we're not quite there yet, or this has got delayed to the next quarter, or whatever.\
	And I say,\
	absolutely fine, completely understand, these things take time.
	
	I'll drop you an email next quarter, and so I add a reminder in to do that. So every email has to be carefully followed up. 

	
---
- ***show interest, tell them they can ask you to stop, but don't give up***\
	
	And you might think, well, are you banging against a closed door? 
	Are you wasting your time? No, so often, these emails turn into something eventually, so often.
	
	And I often get emails back going you know what, Paul, I'm really grateful you kept pursuing this. It kept getting pushed down my list, and I never got around to it, but your emails reminded me,  So don't be afraid, very rarely do you annoy people. And I often adopt a very apologetic tone in them as well.

	I'll say look,\
	`I don't wanna annoy you, but I don't wanna seem disinterested either. `
	
	And it is about showing genuine interest in their project and what they're trying to do.

	Give them permission to tell you to stop. Say look,\
	if I'm annoying you, just drop me an email, let me know.
	I don't wanna annoy you. But I don't wanna give up, because this looks like a really interesting project, and show an interest. 

## how to engage with a new lead when they first contact you

So somebody dropped you an email says,\
I got this project that we're thinking about doing. Is this the kind of thing that you might be able to help with? 

I often get emails like, do you do this kind of thing?\
Because, I've never come out explicitly and said these are the services I offer, but they still contact me anyway.

So first of all,\
**arrange a call as soon as possible.**\
Speaking to somebody over Zoom instantly builds a relationship that you just cannot build in the same way via email. So get them on a Zoom call, get them talking. 

I use a tool called Calendar.ly to let them book a meeting in themselves without that endless backwards and forwards over trying to arrange your time.

Second,\
**try and understand their challenge.**\
And on that call, I will help them in any way I can. So I'll let them pick my brain, I'll give them all the advice I can. I don't hold back anything. And some people do abuse that.\
Occasionally I get people that will basically ask for a call, have a load of advice, getting hours free consultancy from me, and I never hear from them again.

But they're the minority, most people are pretty good. They don't like to abuse your time, and so I will give them as much advice as I can. I'm there to help. If they hire me, that's a bonus. They almost always do. 

Third,\
**Discuss Budget**\
Then on that call discuss budget,\
And the reason I discuss that is because I can very much tailor what I provide based on the budget they've got available. 

So I ask the client if they've got any budgetary constraints. If they say they don't, that's normally a lie. Not necessarily a conscious lie, it's just it's their way of saying, I haven't thought about budget.


But in truth, they've got constraints. So what I do is I start throwing around some numbers and gauge their reaction.

So they'll say, we don't have a budget. And I say, so if I came back with a million and a half project, you're happy with that? No, 50,000?

No, we could probably do 50,000. What about 100,000? And so you're beginning to kinda narrow it down and just have a frank conversation about it. 

And the way I do is I say, it's a bit like buying a house,\
The first thing a real estate is gonna ask you is, ==how much can you afford to spend?==

Because even if you say you want a three bedroom house that's detached in a nice area, well, okay.\
But the price could still will vary wildly depending on what other facilities it's got, what condition it's in, etc. So without a budget, you've got no framework within which to work to suggest a good solution.

So I always discuss budget up front. 

**Don't be afraid challenge**\
don't be afraid to challenge in these conversations.\
If a client comes to you saying they want a mobile app, and you think that's a terrible idea, tell them it's. Well, don't tell them it's a terrible idea.

But say, well, have you considered doing this instead? If you disagree with their suggestions, it's okay to say so.

**Be a peer and an advisor, not a supplier.**

And the reason you can get away with that is because,\
you've been their peer and advisor for weeks, or months, or years, as they've read your stuff. 

They want you to come up with ideas. They're expecting the same from you that they've been reading.\
So that's how you go about engaging with leads as they come in.


## Create a Proposal

In many cases, the proposal will be a formality. The client have already decided they want to work with you. However, take the proposal seriously as you don't know who else will read it.



The client has already decided they want to work with me before they even contacted me. And, I've discussed budget, I've discussed scope. It's all been agreed and that the proposal really is a matter of me writing that all down so that it's in a written format.

However that said, I do make an effort with my proposals simply because I know other people might read them


So this is the, I use a tool called qwiil, qwiil.com. I think I might have a link in here somewhere. And I like it because you've got templates. And you can just fill in the template, and it does it a lot faster.


###### What to include in a proposal

![[Pasted image 20240827114515.png]]

**Engagement Evaluation**\
the first section in my proposals is called engagement evaluation.

> Start by explaining the need they have for help. Avoid talking about the company 


And I just start by explaining the need that they have for my help, why they want me. 

But to repeat back to them why they need to hire you, well, that's a whole another ball game. 

**objectives**\
The second section is objectives\
include 4-6 objectives, these are desirable outcomes.

where I outline a small number of objectives that the project should deliver.
For example,\
one objective might be to increase the number of leads.

So that really focuses people on the benefits that working with me will provide, because those are the objectives they're trying to reach.

==*By the way, these blue bits in between their testimonials from various clients*==. They're always good to put in, especially if they're big names, it always helps.

So for each of my objectives, we need a way of knowing whether those objectives have been achieved or not.

Then we've got **measures of success.**\
The metric by which we will measure our success in achieving the above objectives are.

write down some how we're gonna measure success, and that reassures the client and sets you up for more work when you can actually demonstrate success.


![[Pasted image 20240827114913.png]]


When you go back at the end of the project, and go look, we agreed with these, I've delivered all of these, then they're more likely to hire you again. 

So I include that in there.


Next section is the **value.** 

> For each objective, attempt to tie it to a tangible (ideally monetary) return. Doing so will make your price look much more reasonable.


![[Pasted image 20240827122319.png]]

The anticipated value of achieving the above objective for {org} will be:

> Aim to have at least to value statements for each objective, with at least half of these having a monetary value.

Now a lot of people skip over this, the value to the company.

For each of my objectives, I attempt to tie it to a tangible, ideally monetary return.\
Doing this makes your price look a lot more reasonable. Now we go into a conversation about pricing over lunch, and the subject value brace pricing came up. \
This idea of your fee is related to the benefit that it provides.

It's a really tricky one to do. And in most cases, for the type of work I do at least, I haven't been able to make it work. But what I have taken away from value-based pricing is this idea of showing the value that you are going to be providing ideally in monetary terms, so I do that.

Then we get into the **methodology**. 

> Always offer the client multiple options.
> - one that is slightly within their budget
> - one is slightly more than their budget
> - one that ignores their budget but delivers the best value.


![[Pasted image 20240827123703.png]]


And basically there's one that is going to come in just under their budget, right, so whatever we agreed the budget should be.

Then we're gonna do a second one that's slightly higher than their budget, with a few extra bells and whistles that are appropriate.

And then the third one, I totally ignored their budget and just spec it up as if I was doing it as good as I possibly could, right?

Amazing, it's amazing how many times they end up picking the deluxe version, right? If you always stick within their budget that the client has said, you're throwing away good work, basically.\
And you're not always giving the client the best solution either because you're having to stick within the budget they've given you.


**Section that outlines the benefit**

> have a section that outlines the benefits you in particular provide.
> So define both why you're a right fit and why you might not be.



![[Pasted image 20240827125432.png]]



So just to give you a snippet of how I do that, I say at the end,

ultimately whether you hire me comes down to your ambitions for digital.

If you consider digital key to your long-term business success, I'm probably the right choice. However, if it is seen as an important but secondary component, there may be better and cheaper suppliers.

So I'm positioning myself in a very particular place in the market. And I begin that section by saying I'm not the cheapest option there, right?

So don't be afraid to exclude yourself sometimes because actually saying what you're not reinforces what your others aren't. 


> [!tip] Value based pricing principle
> the value that you charge to the value you create. 


**Logistics**

> Make sure you also include a section addressing things like timing & the role of both the client & yourself.

how long is it gonna take?
Who's gonna do it?
What's the role of both myself and the client? All of that kind of stuff. 

And then actually, because I use this app called Quiller, allows me to create an interactive pricing table that lets people pick whatever option they want, lets them change certain criteria.

So for example,\
I often do usability testing, and they can change the number of people I do testing with to adjust the price. They get it all right as they want it, they click the Accept button, and then they can actually sign there and then within the app.



**I don't pitch**\
And I think if you can build the process that I've talked about here, and if you can get through all of the, if you can build up that audience, if you can nurture that audience, if you can handle them right as they come in, then you're not gonna have to pitch for work.

**Because the client will already know they want to work with you.**

And occasionally, there was a period of time when I would do the occasional pitch because the company had said so, we've got to procurement and yeah, I'm sorry we have to do a pitch. I mean, I'd only ever do them if they basically turned around and said yeah, we are gonna go with you but we have to jump through the hoops.
