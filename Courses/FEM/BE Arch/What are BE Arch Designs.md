>[!quote] Success begins with understanding.
>Before, we lay a single brick, its crucial that we fully grasp the blueprint, for a through comprehension of the foundation leads to a structure that hands the test of time.

>[!tldr] Definition
>The process of defining the modularity, interfaces, and data flow for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

### Key Principles
- modularity\
	is it modular enough?\
	are we reusing things at the right place coupled in the right way.
- scalability\
	how much traffic are we gonna have?
- robustness
- flexibility
	able to support future changes.




>[!tldr] ***Modularity***
> Each component of the system should have a specific task


> [!tldr] ***Scalability***
>  Systems should be designed to handle growth of traffic


> [!tldr] ***Robustness***
> Systems should be able to handle errors or unexpected situations.\
> think about errors, how is beings handled, how to track those errors.


> [!tldr] ***flexibility***
> systems should be designed to accommodate changes or future fetures



### Key Challenges
- complexity
- adaptability
- security
- technology
- resources
- stakeholders

>[!tldr] Complexity
>Handling the intricate details and interdepencies in a system can be complex.

> [!tldr] Adaptibility
> Designing systems that can adapt to changing business needs is challenging.


>[!tldr] Security
> Ensuring the security of data & processes with the system is a constant concern.

> [!tldr] Technology
> Choosing the right technology stack for the system is crucial & can be difficult


> [!tldr] Resources
> allocating the right resources for the system's development & maintenances can be a challenge



> [!tldr] Stakeholder alignment
> Getting all stakeholders to agree on the system's design can sometimes be a difficult task.
