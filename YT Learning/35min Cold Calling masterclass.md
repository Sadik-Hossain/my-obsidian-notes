## Overcoming fear of Cold Calling

just stand up, be confident, and do it every single day, even if it's just 30 minutes.

being consistent is automatically going to make you more confident. 

if you go through 30 calls and get A million voicemails and then pitch one person. Even if you're nervous for that call. 

the second you pitch someone, it's like this exhilarating feeling where you get the energy and that adrenaline rush that makes you want to keep going.

<u>**Mindset**</u>\
you don't have to feel good to get started, but you do have to get started to feel good.

that anxious, nervous feeling. It will never go away. No matter how long you've been doing it.\
so, you've got to be able to **separate how you feel inside from taking action.**

the other things is,\
**your success in sales is going to be determined by the number of uncomfortable conversations that you're willing to go seek.**

cold calling is the best and the fastest way, to go have those uncomfortable conversations. And you gotta do it. And once you actually start taking action,
you get in the groove. 

Once you have that first pitch, you feel good, and then you can get going.

You gotta get started, though. That is the most important thing.
The Act of separating how you feel about something.

## Cold Call Openers

> ***shift from telemarketer to respected peer by adding context and researching.***

making a well researched, or at the very least, pretty well targeted cold call.

And there's context for why you are making that cold call,\
whether it's you found a trigger, a piece of research that made you say, hey, I should call this person, or they're very tight in your ICP (Ideal Client Profile).

**always use a tailored permission opener.**

for ex:

```
Hey, Sarah, I just finished reading your job posting about the new AES your team is hiring for.
My name's Jhon, and I know I'm calling you out of the blue. Do you mind if I get half a minute? I'll share why I called you specifically, and then you can tell me whether or not it's worth a chat. 
```

And what I'm doing there is I'm actually **leading with the context.**

`I saw you were hiring for those AEs` and that gets them to sit up and say, Oh, This is not just like a random telemarketing call.


This is a targeted, intentional cold call. 

So context, is really interesting. because you're really trying to show them you're not like others, You're trying to shift from telemarketer to respected peer. 

Another example,\
```
Hey Jason, I work with a few other partners in the downtown LA office of SCAD and it's Armand from Northwestern. 
Hey, have you heard my name tossed around? or, can you help me with something / can you help me answering a few things? / do you know if someone can help me with something?
```

And he goes no, I haven't, but **how can I help you?** *(say something that invokes this `how can I help you?` response)*


you open like a peer. And even if he isn't interested in what you have to offer, he's not going to be a complete jerk. Because, you work with other people of his status.

**In other words, I've established that I'm one of his peers.**

## Cold Call Tonality

> The two most common culprits are:
> - number one, up tones
> - number two, talking way too quickly.


The higher up you go in the chain of command with executives, the slower they talk. 

intentionally talk very slowly. And the reason for this is you need time to compose your thoughts.


Otherwise, you're going to start stammering and start using ums and ahs and all this stuff and sound really nervous. 

But if slow it down, you give yourself time to think.

Number two, a lot of times when people are unsure, or if you're asking a question, you'll end in an uptone. 

And it's okay to end with questions in an uptone, or if you're leading to a point. But most of your sentences, if you listen to your conversations with friends, end in downtones. 

So if you can do those two things, if you can slow down and if you can notice some of your uptones.

if you want to get a down tone out of yourself,

you tilt your chin down. And if you tilt your chin up, it'll actually help you get the up tone. So if you want to have an up tone when you're asking a question, tilt the chin up. If you want to have a down tone, Tilt your chin down.

## Value Proposition

So we do a permission based opener or the Have You Heard Her Name Tossed Around opener, let's talk about what to say next.

The common mistake is, people get into product speak and they start talking about their solution and there's no context provided to the prospect.
