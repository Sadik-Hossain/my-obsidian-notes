<center> <b><u>capturing attention (by creating intrigue) is the first step of seduction</b></u></center>

if you can retain a woman’s attention for a sufficiently long period of time, she will eventually fall in love with you. 
This is because when a woman’s attention is captured, her self-awareness fades, and her emotions take over.

<u>Note:</u>
seduction begins and ends with the mental engagement of a woman. Engage a woman long enough, and she will eventually yield to you.

most decisions made by a woman are not made through rational analysis, but through her “female intuition” or the “gut”.

If you are able to covertly guide and influence a woman’s intuition, you will be able to control her emotions.

##### The Female Brain Can’t Get “Hot” And “Cold” At The Same Time
---
Whenever the female brain relies on its gut or intuition to make decisions, it is said to be in “Hot” mode. 
Correspondingly, when she makes calculated decisions (for example, when she is doing mental math when grocery shopping), her brain is said to be in “Cold” mode.

The female brain can’t get “Hot” and “Cold” simultaneously. It’s psychologically impossible.

By keeping her brain continuously in the “Hot” mode, she will continue to be overrun by her emotions with her analytical brain disengaged.


##### How to keep her in "HOT" mode
---
The female brain is on constant lookout For Novelty And Amusement.
Women take pleasure in encountering something which looks fresh, novel and amusing.
Finding out about **new things**, **situations** and **challenges** is what gets her into the “Hot” mode.

When you meet a woman for the first time (and especially when you’re doing a cold approach), you instantly activate the “Hot” part of her brain. 
During the first few seconds of the approach, her brain tells her -“Who is this guy, and what does he want?”


During these few seconds, you have her attention. This is a fleeting moment, and she continues to be fixated on you while her brain tries to answer this question – “Is this guy the same like the others who tried to hit on me, or is he different?”
As soon as her brain “decides” that you no different than the other boring guys who tried to hit on her that night, she will mentally check out on you. At this point, you would have lost her attention, and the seduction game would be over.
She disengages when she feels that she has learned enough about you to understand you and your motivations. It’s pointless to engage you further because she would not gain anything more from you.
When the female brain “solves” the puzzle in front of her, she loses interest and will start to look for the next puzzle to tackle.

##### develop intrigue story
---
You already know that she can’t process both “Hot” (narrative) and “Cold” (analytical) information simultaneously. 
And since rejection decisions are made “Cold”, you want to break her from that mode by telling her an Intrigue Story.

When you deliver your story, you are going to ***create intrigue by only revealing part of the story in order to incorporate an element of suspense in the storyline.***

To recap what we’ve covered so far: 
you first capture her attention by telling her a provocative, personal story (with you as the central character).
You keep her attention by inserting cliffhangers in the story, and by not revealing the end until the moment comes (i.e. when you’re escalating to the Rapport phase).

##### 5 elements of a good Intrigue Story
---
1. **Element of Brevity:** it has got to be simple to narrate 
2. **Element of Focus:** you must be central to the story 
3. **Element of Danger:** there must be risk and uncertainty in the story 
4. **Element of Time Constraint:** you need to perform a task before the time is up, or there are dire consequences 
5. **Element of Conflict:** you are being impeded/hindered/encountered by your enemy or by an unfavorable situation.
The best Intrigue Stories have all five elements, but even a story with two or three will work.

##### Capture Her Attention With The Cliffhanger 
---

When you approach the most interesting part of the story, stop and pull away. 
leaving a story unfinished just about when it reaches its climax. (an unanswered question)

This will keep her fixated on your story until you are ready to reveal the climax. Until then, you **keep her captivated by introducing twists and turns in the story with the use of the Cliffhanger technique.**

A great example is the show Game of Thrones, it employs more and more Cliffhangers in the plot - intriguing the viewer with the untimely death of its characters, heartless betrayals and **open loops which take a long time to resolve themselves.**

a variant of the Cliffhanger technique not in a story, but in the form of an unanswered question in the woman’s mind.

##### Captivate Imagination With Multiple Sub-Plots
---
Sub plots are like conversational threads. 

A good Intrigue Story, like life, is never a straight line from start till the end. 

For a story to be both realistic and interesting, you will need sub plots – these are minor storylines that progress over time alongside the main plot.

Sub plots serve to add conflict and color to the main story.

>***In seduction, keeping a series of sub plots in a conversation will create the illusion that you and the woman you met have lots to talk about.***

It’s rarely a good idea to dwell on a single topic of conversation until it is dry. Within about ten minutes, any (single) conversation thread will inevitably turn stale.
Eventually, it will be painfully obvious to her that you’re trying in vain to keep the interaction alive only because you’re hitting on her.

To avoid this, within the first five minutes of interaction, you want to create as many sub plots as you can. 
This is so that when the initial conversation topic dries up, you can then latch to another “fresh” thread to keep the conversation going.

<u>So this is how you create multiple sub plots:</u>

**whenever she speaks, de-construct her sentences to find opportunities to start new conversational threads.**

<u>Here’s an example: </u>
If she says, “I’ve been working as a trainee nurse for three months”, here are some possible sub plots you can pursue:
1. What’s the difference between a “trainee” nurse and a “proper” nurse?
2. Any interesting hospital stories? (Think ER) 
3. What was she doing before that?
4. What she loves and hates being a nurse?
5. Does she get hit on by the doctors?

<u>Caution:</u>
**you don’t want to fire up a barrage of questions immediately to risk overwhelming her.**
Overwhelm is frequently a trigger for a woman to turn from “Hot” to “Cold”. The general rule of thumb is to go for the most interesting sub plot which is also the least obvious.

> ***you can also transition into an unrelated topic to give you even more opportunities to create fresh sub plots and new conversational threads.***

<u>For example:</u>
you can say, “Before we get to that, I have to ask you, why are you carrying these hats?” or something contextual, like what is she wearing, etc.
