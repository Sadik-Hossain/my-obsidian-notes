Most of our decision is emotional.

We have a primal brain, it also refers as lizard brain.

Its responsible for primitive survival instincts such as aggression and fear (flight or fight).

**This is a critical part of our decision making process.**

for ex:
if u ever been to a website, that uses technique like **fear**
- fear of missing out
- fear of something goin wrong

this are manipulation that are encouraging to make a decision / take an action. 

Equally, if u go to a website and it plays off the **Scarcity**.
- this product will run out soon
- this offer is time limited

This techniques are aiming at that primal brain.

But, the problem with primal brains are encouraging to take action ethically as well.

for example,
the primal brain like to hoard things.\
It doesnt like to give up stuff, like paying money, hand over personal info, **bcz of it afraid of what will happen**.


> [!NOTE] our Primal brain are constantly looking for dangers & risks all the time.
> Its the bit that kept us alive in the savannahs of africa, bcz of it was looking for movement in the bushes that could be some saber tooth, that was gonna rip us apart.

**So, we need to understand the primal brain\
And understand how to calm it.\
so that it enable us to encourage ppl to take action.**
