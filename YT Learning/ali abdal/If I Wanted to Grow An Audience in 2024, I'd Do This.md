##### How to generate content ideas
---
ideas stem from niche. Niche is the culmination of  2 things:
- target
- value

who is the Target?
what is the value?

so, for example, \
as a marketing agency owner, the target could be other marketing agency owners, and teaching them how to grow their business.

for example,\
targeting b2c consumer brand managers\
and trying to teach them how to use TikTok ads to level up their b2c campaigns.

after that,\
what are all the different content buckets of ideas?

what's the best selling books on that?\
what's popular on blogs, that are targeting that audience?\
what are the other YouTube channels in that space?\
sort them by most popular views & see what videos went viral?

 
<u><b>viral replication/idea dj</b></u>\
basically, the easiest way to get content that works,\
is to copy the title and thumbnail of another piece of content, that has worked and then just do it in your own way!

so you're not really plagiarizing them, just repackaging them.

##### How to find your unfair advantage
---
**what does a 10% edge really mean?**

when you're just a few steps ahead of your students -- those that you server\
you know what its like to be in their shoes, and you can empathize with their struggles. \
you've been where they're at, you can provide them with the guidance and the support that they need in order to take the very next step in their journey.

- you serve the people, whos a few steps behind you.
- you basically think yourself as a guide instead of guru.
- you share where you are currently at and how can they get there, who's are few steps behind you.

ali started as being a guide for medical students helping them get into med school and then they got into med school and people started asking for advice on how to study for exams?

and he was like,\
"okay, I can do that!"\
so he reads a few papers, studied psychology as part of medical degree and started sharing the Gary vee model of documenting.

he was documenting the stuff that he was doing to study for his own exams.

again, you don't need to be a guru here!\
you're just literally like,

hey, here's how I take notes\
here's how I study for this exam\
here's what I discovered about how to build a study timetable

And like that his channel started to grow:\
people started to question like,

which books do you read?\
what are the best productivity app?\
How you manage your time?\
How do you use notion?\
How are you so productive?\
Productivity desk setup?

so, basically he grown his channel by making contents which answers audiences inquiries, and helping them to get where he is at.

bcz, a lot of people questions, he is a doctor, he does youtube, he does vacation trip, he does this, that, he got social life. How is he so productive?

and now if anyone asks what one word describes ali? its productivity.\
He is also not niched locked, he is also going adjacent like business, tech, books, health, relationship, money anything that is associated with helping people be more productive.

**Continuous Improvement**
Its a continuous improvement journey, there has to be a difference between yesterday's you, & today's you.\
Small small upgrades in your life, learning new things, trying new things, getting new results.

so that, you always has that gap (past you vs present you) that you can share to your audience who is few steps behind you. Basically, think of it like giving advice to your past self.

That is your edge, your uniqueness.

Don't stay stuck at same place, level up. Grow and document the journey & progress.

##### How to systemize your content
---
 **how to put a small amount of time to get the maximum results in terms of contents?**

In terms of YouTube,\
==most views that comes from are basically title and thumbnail==\
in terms of the packaging of the video, if no one clicks on the title and thumbnail.\
no one's actually going to see the content.

so spending a decent chunk of time on the packaging is super helpful.

==then, when it comes to the content, the hook plus the structure is the main thing.==\
so for the hook -- it would be the first 30 seconds\
for the structure -- it would be the sort of rough three-part structure of video *(timestamps of others are a good starting point).* 

content creation can be systemized, it's not really a creativity thing\
it's more like systems and processes and SoP.


> [!quote]
> *Creativity is a systematic process*
> - will guidara

so the more you can systemize content creation\
the less you need to worry about being a creative person and the more
you can actually get results.

##### How to stay consistent
---
it's about patience and faith

it's about patience becz, that it takes a long time for this stuff to see results and
it's about faith becz, that if you do the right things and show up consistently\
then, eventually the results will come.

==the main strategy for consistency is to set input goals.==\
==goals that are within your control.==\
like it's not within your control, whether you hit 10,000 subscribers or get a million views on a video.

but it is within your control, that you can show up every week and share something authentically, that would add value to the target audience. 

and make that process at least Valuable, enjoyable and just know that you have to do it for 2 years.

==if you want to do YouTube,\
commit to posting a video every single week for 2 years==

that's the kind of time Horizon you need.

the problem is when people do it like, \
"oh, I'm not seeing any results 2 months later"  \
"I'm still terrible at making videos, I've never talked to a camera before in my life"\
but for some reason I'm expecting results from day one.

that's just completely absurd.

if it was easy, everyone would have seven figure businesses based on organic content marketing, but it's not.

it's going to start off feeling like a really heavy lift, where you're like recording for an hour and getting 10 minutes of content out of it.
you will feel like, it's not worth it it takes too long to edit.

you have to push through that pain.

==you've got to build the systems and tools and knowledge, that businesses uses to leverage yourself\
so that you can create content at scale.==

early on like first one year or so ali was literally thinking,\
okay, it's a new week. I need a new video. what's the video going to be this week?\
let's make the video\
come up with ideas, write it, film it, edit it.

trying to do that all while in medical school in a week, hit upload as the video is uploading figuring out the title and the thumbnail

and then realized,\
hang on! this is a recipe for Burnout. this is not sustainable, he need to systemize the whole thing.

and then there's a book called The e- Myth Revisited by Michael Gober.\

It introduced to the idea of systemization and delegation.

after reading that,\
Ali need to think of his YouTube channel as a franchise, as the Prototype for a franchise.
 
you know, how you can walk into any McDonald's anywhere in the world and you get an identical experience.\
the same food, the same experience!
 
they can put any random 16-year-old with zero qualifications into one of those jobs, follow the process and will get the result for the customer.

so, how do you therefore create systems and structures, in your own business that make it a theoretical franchise?

what is the system, that would follow to franchise out ali's YouTube channel.

##### How to delegate
---
there's a process for idea generation\
there's a process for writing\
there's a process for filming\
there's a process for editing\
there's a process for publishing etc etc.

and initially Ali was doing all of these things himself and then very slowly
over time, started delegating small bits of that.

so now, someone else does the idea generation\
someone else does the research for some of the videos\

Ali still do the writing. He tried and found it very hard to outsource it for own video because, it doesn't match the vibe & theme.

Ali still film his own videos. then, someone else edits.
someone else publishes, someone else repurposes, someone else looks at the analytics.

someone takes the footage and turn it into like Instagram and Twitter thread and a LinkedIn Carousel and an Instagram Carousel.

Ali has a whole repurposing process as well.

cuz what we found is that we've put in all the effort to make the video.\
we might as well chop it up and turn it into a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn thread
a kind of Carousel\
and repurpose it across all the different social platforms.

that is what the six years later,
the evolution of the content pipeline looks like. with a team of 14 people. 10 of which are basically focused on the content side. 

He now focus his time on the thing, which he is good at\
everyone else does the rest of the things, that he is bad at.
